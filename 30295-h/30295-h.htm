<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>I use the word "Social" in the title of this work to suggest
that, save in an auxiliary way, I am not attempting to describe
the religious features of the organization. Such a field of investigation
would prove a very profitable and interesting one, but
it is a field, which, for the sake of clearness and impartial study,
should be kept separate. The organization itself recognizes the
primary division. Commander Booth-Tucker, the leader of the
Army in the United States from 1896 to 1904, says, "The Salvation
Army is the evolution of two great ideas: first, that of
reaching with the gospel of salvation the masses who are outside
the pale of ordinary church influence, and second, that of
caring for their temporal as well as spiritual interests."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I have secured very little data from books, as there is but
little authentic literature on the subject. Primarily, the data for
this treatise were taken from personal observation. In pursuing
the subject I have visited Salvation Army social institutions of
every description. In addition to visiting the larger cities of the
United States and the three Army colonies, situated in Ohio,
Colorado and California, respectively, I have investigated the
work in London, where the Army had its origin, and at the farm
colony in Hadleigh, on the river Thames, some thirty miles from
London. I have slept in the hotels, worked in the industrial
homes, wandered over the farm colonies, and mingled with the
inmates of other types of Army institutions.</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h2>


<p>The Salvation Army was founded by William Booth in London,
England, in 1865. Previous to this time Mr. Booth had
been a successful clergyman in the Methodist Church, and had
become widely known throughout England as a revivalist. As
time passed, he had become more and more interested in the condition
of the un-churched masses, and as his church did not approve
of his taking up work among the masses in connection
with it as an organization, he had, in 1861, separated from the
Methodists. With little support, he established in London what
was known as The Christian Mission.</p>

<p>From the first, numbers of converts were made, and soon several
missions were established in London, and other cities
of England. From the first, too, the agency of women was an
important feature. Especially was this true in visitation among
the lower classes. In regard to the foundation of the Army itself
and in connection with its earlier successes, much credit must be
given to Mrs. Booth, the wife of William Booth. She became as
noted a speaker and revivalist as her husband, and together, they
made plans for the movement. Unfortunately she died of cancer
in 1890. Through these early years of the movement its management,
almost unconsciously, developed along lines that were military
in form. At first the title of "Captain" was used among the
sailors and fishermen to designate the local leader of the company,
and then it was extended wherever, among the rough element, the
"Mr." or "Rev." would seem out of place. The usage and the
spirit accompanying it soon spread, and by the year 1879 military
methods and titles were officially added. The Rev. Wm.
Booth, who, up to this time, had been known as "Superintendent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>of the Christian Mission," became "General" Booth, and the
"Mission" became the "Salvation Army."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This addition of military methods seems to have accelerated
the movement by favoring efficient and systematic control. Soon
after this time, we find, the organization had spread to the
United States, Canada, Australia, France, Switzerland, Holland,
Belgium, Scandinavia, Germany and Italy. Then missionary
work was taken up in India, and later on, in Africa, Java and
Japan. At the present time (1908), according to its reports, the
Army occupies fifty-two different countries and colonies. In no
country has its rate of progress been more remarkable than in
the United States, where in point of numbers, the local organization
now ranks second only to that of Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Along with the rapid growth went a differentiation almost as
rapid and unique as the growth itself. In fact, both reacted on
each other. The work was separated first into three main departments,
viz.: Spiritual, Social and Trade. It will be necessary
to make a brief statement of this differentiation in detail. In
the Spiritual Department we have the extension of the original
idea, that of converting the people. Corps, as the different religious
groups were called, sprang up and multiplied until even
the smaller towns were occupied. Converts were added by hundreds
and thousands. Large numbers of the brightest and best
of these converts were utilized in extending the work still further,
and after undergoing a brief training, were sent out, some
to aid the movement in the mother country, others to begin the
work in different parts of Europe and in America, and still others
as missionaries to all parts of the world. Meanwhile, the work
in each local organization or Corps, became systematized, and
the Corps were united into Sections or Divisions, the Divisions
into larger districts called Provinces, and the Provinces into
Commands, which for the most part controlled the territory of
an entire country. Each of these divisions from the Corps to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>Command, was delegated to an officer who had sole charge, and
who was responsible to the officer above him. For example, the
United States, at present, is divided into two Commands; the
first extending from New York to Chicago; the second from
Chicago to the Pacific Coast. The first Command has six Provinces;
the second, four. Each Province has from three to nine
Divisions, and each Division contains a number of Corps. Thus,
while each Corps is complete in itself, the general administration
is very highly centralized; so much so, that an order from General
Booth at the National Headquarters, London, England, must be
obeyed by every Corps in the world.</p>

<p>While the organization of the Spiritual Department was taking
place in this manner, the Social Work was assuming large proportions,
and differentiating itself. Visitation in the lower parts
of the cities was organized into a regular department of Slum
Work, called the Slum Department, with a specialized corps of
officers. Work among fallen women was instituted as the Rescue
Department, with its rescue homes and trained workers. The
establishment of hotels and lunch counters for both men and
women became finally what is now the Social Department. The
wood yards and small factories, together with the salvage depots
and cheap stores, were organized into the Industrial Department.
Work among the children resulted in the establishment of kindergartens
and orphanages. The colonization enterprise took root,
and was divided into the industrial colonies and farm colonies.
Thus, we have here a differentiation of the original Social Department
into six distinct divisions, which we shall consider separately
in this treatise. As these lines of work advanced, although
each had its special group of workers, it was natural that the
work should follow the administrative system of Commands,
Provinces, Divisions and Corps, which had already been marked
out in the Spiritual Department.</p>

<p>The third primary division, that of trade, has had some interesting
developments. There is, for example, the trade carried
on in articles necessary to the members of the Army them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>selves,
and which they cannot conveniently obtain in the open
market, such as uniforms, badges, books and musical instruments.
The Reliance Trading Company, for instance, was incorporated
in 1902, under the laws of the State of New Jersey. This company
owns and publishes the "War Cry," the official gazette of
the Army in the United States; does the printing for the various
departments of the Army; manufactures fountain pens; makes
uniforms, bonnets and hats for the Army members; conducts
an Insurance Department, and carries on other business enterprises.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>There is, too, the trade in the products of the various factories
and industries connected with the relief work of the Army.
For example, the Salvation Army Industrial Homes Company,
incorporated in New Jersey, has greatly facilitated the industrial
work in the United States. There have been companies
formed and organized as building societies, insurance
companies, and a Salvation Army Bank.</p>

<p>In all these companies the Salvation Army, through its officers,
always has control, although it invites and seeks investments
from the public. The following extract, taken from a prospectus
sent out by the Salvation Army Industrial Homes Company,
illustrates the point:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Charter of our Industrial Homes Co. has been prepared by
Messrs. Jas. B. Dill &amp; Co., the eminent corporation lawyers, who
have kindly given us the full benefit of their skill and experience,
at a fairly nominal charge. The capital consists of $500,000.00,
divided into 50,000 shares, of the par value of $10.00 each, of
which 25,000 are in 6% cumulative preferred stock and 25,000 in
common stock. Only the preferred shares are offered to the public,
and bear interest at 6%, which is guaranteed by the Army. The
common shares are held by the Army, with a view to retaining the
control of the company, and the entire profits, over and above the
interest on the preferred stock, are thus devoted to the charitable
and religious work of the Army, and help us to continually expand
and enlarge our homes." ... "We shall be happy to supply any information
or answer any questions as to the financial standing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>the Salvation Army. For our spiritual and social operations in
the United States, we have now an annual income of nearly $2,000,000.00,
while the value of our real estate holdings in this country
amount to about $1,500,000. Hence, it will be seen that in guaranteeing
the interest upon these preferred shares, amounting in all
to only $15,000.00, we are abundantly able to insure the regular payment
of the same apart, altogether, from the income of our industrial
homes."</p></div>

<p>As a result of this rapid growth along the three lines described,
the movement everywhere forced itself upon public recognition.
The publication of its weekly organ, the "War Cry," in many
different languages and countries aided its growth. Other magazines
of higher class and better quality were issued. At the same
time, the public press investigated the organization, and for a
long time criticised it harshly. In fact, during all this time,
while so successful, the Army suffered much persecution. The
crowds of people composed of those whom it was seeking to
benefit, seemed often to be its worst enemies, and then, to make
matters more difficult, the police, we are told, instead of furnishing
protection, often, themselves, joined in the persecution. There
were many instances, in this early period, where the enthusiastic
reformers were ill treated and even fatally injured. There was,
however, some reason for all this persecution. A movement so
sudden and apparently so contrary to existing institutions, needed
time for its real principle to become known. The external manifestation
seemed to consist of nothing but defiant disregard of
established religious custom and ceremonial. Thus, while the
vital principle of love for humanity was working its way into
individual lives and attracting them to the ranks of the organization,
the world at large openly showed its antagonism. Gradually,
however, the sense of public opposition and antagonism grew
less. Gradually the knowledge that, behind the superficial emotionalism,
were depths of disinterested sympathy for fellow men
and women worked itself into the public mind. Attacks on Army
groups on street corners became less frequent, and when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>did occur, were suppressed by the police. The press ceased
its bitter criticism.</p>

<p>It was about this time that renewed and increased attention
was focused on the new movement by the publication in 1890 of
General Booth's famous book, "In Darkest England, and the
Way Out." In some ways the book served to mark a new epoch
in the development of that part of practical sociology which
concerns itself with the direct betterment of the lower class of
society. The old method of dealing with the poor is ably described
by Ruskin, when he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We make our relief either so insulting to them, or so painful
that they rather die than take it at our hands; or, for third alternative,
we leave them so untaught and foolish, that they starve like
brute creatures, wild and dumb, not knowing what to do, or what
to ask."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></div>

<p>This was a point of view which in its relation to the degraded
elements of society was an expression of sympathy rather
than of harsh criticism and mistrust. Although it had been set
forth by others previously, it had never before forced itself so
strongly on the public. In addition, the daring statements and
bold theories, given utterance in "Darkest England," served to
surprise all schools of reform. The public consciousness had
never before faced the problem in such a way. It was aroused,
and began to ask questions. The book ran through edition
after edition. It was printed in a cheap form and within a
short time was circulated all over the civilized world.</p>

<p>In his "scheme" General Booth laid down seven fundamental
principles, which he claimed were essential to success. They
were as follows:</p>

<p>1. The first principle that must be bore in mind, as governing
every scheme that may be put forward, is that it must
change the man, when it is his character and conduct which
constitute the reasons for his failure in the battle of life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>2. The remedy, to be effectual, must change the circumstances
of the individual, when they are the cause of his wretched condition,
and lie beyond his control.</p>

<p>3. Any remedy worthy of consideration must be on a scale
commensurate with the evil with which it proposes to deal.</p>

<p>4. Not only must the scheme be large enough, but it must be
permanent.</p>

<p>5. But while it must be permanent, it must be made practicable.</p>

<p>6. The indirect features of the scheme must not be such as to
produce injury to the persons whom we seek to benefit.</p>

<p>7. While assisting one class of the community, it must not seriously
interfere with the interests of another.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>General Booth's personal attitude, also, is well worth noting.
In the preface of his book he makes the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I do not claim that my scheme is either perfect in its details,
or complete in the sense of being adequate to combat all forms of
gigantic evils, against which it is, in the main, directed. Like other
human things, it must be perfected through suffering; but it is a
sincere endeavor to do something, and to do it on principles, which
can be instantly applied and universally developed."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></div>

<p>And again, in view of some of the manifestations of the organization
as we see it, the following is interesting, as coming
from its founder. He says: "But one of the grimmest social
problems of our time should be sternly faced, not with a view to
the generation of profitless emotions, but with a view to its solution."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Upon the publication of this book there arose a division of
opinion in regard to the scheme which was set forth. On the
one hand, numbers of noted philanthropists aided General Booth
with money and moral support. On the other hand, there was
opposition from a certain class of reformers, headed by that
eminent scientist, Thomas Huxley. This opposition, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>did not so much attack the principles advocated, as the agency
for their application, namely, the Salvation Army, itself, characterized
in Huxley's words as "Autocratic socialism, masked by
its theological exterior."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>From that time to the present many thoughtful men have
continued this opposition to the Army as an agent of social service.
Further on we shall consider the validity and strength
of their arguments. At that time the press on all sides took
up the controversy, and it was finally decided to appoint a committee
of investigation to thoroughly examine the Army's methods
and institutions and publish a report. This committee
was composed of some of the leading business and public men
of England, headed by Sir Wilfred Lawson. They examined the
books of the Army and studied the system and methods of the
movement. They reported that all was entirely satisfactory and
not only so, but that the movement and work was worthy of
commendation.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The report of this Committee, together with a demonstration
of the work already accomplished, served to silence the critics
to some extent, and public favor began to turn toward the movement.
Since that period the Army has had, generally speaking,
the support of the press and many of the leading men throughout
the world, a support which it has not been slow to recognize,
or to utilize. For instance, about this time, we find the following
appeal issued through the English press:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"From personal witness or credible report of what General
Booth has done with the funds entrusted to him for the Social
Scheme which he laid before the country eighteen months ago, we
think it would be a serious evil if the great task which he has undertaken
should be crippled by lack of help during the next four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>months. We therefore venture to recommend his work to the
generous support of all, who feel the necessity for some serious
and concentrated effort to grapple with the needs of the most
wretched and destitute, who have so long been the despair of our
legislation and our philanthropy."</p></div>

<p>This appeal was signed by the Earl of Aberdeen, who was
then Governor-General of Canada, and fifteen other men and
women of international reputation. As an example of the attitude
of the press, we find the London Daily Telegraph, in the
midst of a long editorial entitled, "The General's Triumph,"
saying, "There is no question about it, the General has become
popular. He has justified himself by results. We are told he
has not shown the way out, but few have done so much to
let the light in, and to bring with it life and healing."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Since the publication of "In Darkest England" in 1890, the social
work of the Army has been extended, and has grown very
rapidly.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In connection with this rapid growth, the social phase of the
movement has tended to eclipse the spiritual in the public eye.
The Army has taken advantage of this to advertise its advancement
along all lines, and there is reason for believing that the
public support of the whole movement, both social and spiritual,
at the present time, is largely due to this advertising.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
In any case, the social work of the Army is a movement large
enough to justify the interest of the public, and the extensive
study of every student of practical social economy.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Salvation Army Industrial Department.</span></h2>

<p>Originally the work now known as the Industrial Work was
handled with and under the same management as the Social
Work, but as the movement grew, the Industrial Work branched
out and finally became separate in operation and management,
the name "Social Department" being retained for the hotel work
only.</p>


<p>The Industrial Department itself may be divided into three
sections, all under the same management. These are The Industrial
Home, The Industrial Store and The Industrial Colony.
The object of the work embraced in these three divisions as
stated in the prospectus sent out by the Army two years ago is:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One of the most difficult problems that has confronted the Salvation
Army has been the finding of employment for out-of-works
and human derelicts in our cities. A system has been gradually
organized by which this human waste is employed in collecting the
material waste of the city. This latter has been sorted, sifted and
sold, and temporary employment thus afforded to thousands of
stranded persons, who have thus been tided over periods of distress,
relieved of immediate suffering, saved from the stigma of
paupers, assured of human sympathy, and given a new start in
life."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></div>

<p>After a careful review of the various divisions of this work,
above mentioned, we shall consider whether the object is being
attained, and of what value the work done is to society.</p>

<p>In the formation of the Industrial Home the ideal building
and situation cannot always be secured; hence there are differences
in the planning and disposition of the different homes.
The general plan, however, is to have a three or four-story
building fitted up as follows: On the ground floor is a space
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>where the wagons filled with waste materials can unload, a
large room where furniture can be repaired and stored (unless
this is done in the basement below), an office, and another large
room to be used for a retail store. On the second floor is the
sorting room, and adjoining or connected with it is the baling
room, where such stuff as paper, rags and excelsior is pressed,
ready to be taken away. On this floor, too, is to be found the
kitchen, the dining room and the reading room. On the third
floor are situated the dormitories and sleeping rooms. This
plan is often varied. Sometimes there is a basement and only
one or two stories above. Sometimes, as in the Forty-eighth
Street home in New York, there are six or seven stories, and
sometimes, as in one home in Chicago, the sleeping and living
quarters of the men are entirely separate from the warehouse
where they work, possibly some blocks away. The kitchen is
nearly always found to be large and furnished with a good
range and other facilities. The dining room contains long, plain
tables, set so that the men can sit on both sides. The dishes
are of thick, strong ware. The food is plain but good. Everything
from the floor to the dishes is usually clean.</p>

<p>The sleeping rooms are of two kinds, individual rooms and
dormitories. Those men who are of a better rank, that is, those
who have been working long, or who are doing a higher grade
of work, and those who have "boss" positions, occupy the
separate rooms; while the general class of workers sleep in the
dormitories. When it comes to the question of pure air, considerable
difficulty arises. Some of the separate rooms have no
outside window, though the partitions between the rooms rise
only to a certain height, thus giving common air to the whole
floor. Even where good ventilation facilities exist, it seems
difficult to make the men keep the windows open. As regards
ventilation, however, the industrial homes are, as a rule, better
than the lower class workingman's hotels, and are improving in
this respect. The beds are iron, single beds. The bed clothing
and the rooms themselves are clean and fumigated regularly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>A reading room is also provided where daily papers and popular
magazines are kept, and where the men may write. In
some cases, a smoking room adjoins. Meetings of a devotional
character, to which the men may come or not as they see fit,
are often held in the reading room.</p>

<p>The support that renders the industrial home possible is the
waste product of the city. This material is rubbish of all kinds
imaginable. In connection with each industrial plant are kept
a number of horses and wagons, mostly one-horse wagons.
Each driver of a wagon has a definite route to cover regularly.
Passing over his route, he collects everything of which people are
glad to be rid. Waste paper, old clothes, old furniture, and the
like, are the principal articles he collects. Many good people,
persuaded of the good work the Army is doing, save up their
store of odds and ends until the Army wagon shall call, often
giving things away which they would not have thrown away or
given any one else, unless it would be to sell them to an old-clothes
man. The driver returns with his load to the warehouse.
From his wagon the material is conveyed by means of an elevator
to the sorting room in the second story, whence the greater quantity
goes at once to the baling machine in the form of waste
paper. Any articles that may be of use, such as shoes, clothing
of any kind, books, crockery-ware, bottles, pots, kettles, etc., are
placed in their respective bins and finally, repaired, find their
way to the retail store. Heavy articles, such as stoves and furniture,
do not go up in the elevator, but are retained on the first
floor, where they go, first to the repairing and storage room, and
then out to the stores. The paper and rags, when baled, are
sold to the nearest paper mill for a good price. Some idea of
the amount of this class of material may be gained from the
fact that the average amount of paper sold by the Industrial
Department in the United States is about 2,500 tons per month.</p>

<p>In England and other countries this work has not assumed
such large proportions, but there is some difference between the
workings of the industrial plant in the City of London and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>New York. For instance, at the Salvation Army plant on Hanbury
Street, Whitechapel, London, we found, in 1906, a planing
mill, a paint and furniture shop, a mattress factory, and a sawmill
and cabinet shop. This place had employment for ninety
men, of whom twelve were regularly employed and the remainder
were transients. The regular employees were paid at a
union rate of wages. The men of this industrial plant lived some
distance away on Quaker Street, having possession of part of the
Salvation Army shelter or hotel there, the total accommodation
of which was two hundred and forty. Again, in a different part
of the city, over near Deptford, was a wood yard with good
machinery, run by electricity, which employed anywhere from
sixty to seventy men making kindling wood. On the other hand,
at the "Spa Road Elevator," was a plant almost identical with
the industrial plants in the United States, where were shipped
out an average of 100 pounds of paper every week and several
tons of rags in addition, and where was accommodation for
some two hundred men.</p>

<p>Branching out from the main industrial plant are nearly always
to be found large stores. These are Salvation Army retail
stores. These stores are found in the poorest sections of
the city, and are patronized by the poorest class. Articles of
all descriptions may be purchased here at a very low figure. In
each store is a furniture department; a clothing department for
men, women and children; a toy department; a department
for stoves, pots, etc., and sometimes other departments varying
with the size of the store. It is possible, thus, for a poor family
moving into the neighborhood to completely furnish themselves
and their home from Salvation Army stores at a cost of often
less than one-half of what they would pay elsewhere. Each
store has a definite connection with the central industrial plant,
from which it receives its supplies, its workers and its government,
for the stores are merely branches of the central work,
and all are under the same general management.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>An interesting feature lies in an examination of the labor which
is employed. From the cases given at the end of the chapter,
it will be seen that it consists of all kinds, classes and nationalities,
who, through their own recklessness, or by unfortunate circumstances,
have fallen into want. A man willing to work comes
to the Army in want of food and shelter, and the Army happens
to have accommodation for him. He may go to one of the
men's hotels or to the industrial home, or to the central agency
of the Army. In any case he will probably be interviewed by an
officer specially detailed for the purpose, who will be able to
decide in short time what his needs are, and what can be done
for him. He may be sent out at once to take some position secured
through the employment bureau; he may be sent to the
hotel with the understanding that, after being fed and cared for,
he will be given an opportunity to pay for it in work; or he
may be sent straight to the industrial home. In any case, if possible,
he is put to work. He may be in a weak condition physically
or mentally, or both, but even then, he can often do
something; such, for example, as picking over paper and rags
in the sorting room. Meanwhile, he is being fed and housed. If
he means well and works earnestly, he is soon able to do some
other grade of work. He may have had technical knowledge
which will help him. In a few days, possibly, a call is made
to the employment bureau, which is maintained in conjunction
with each home or group of homes, for a man to fill some position.
If suitable, this man may be sent out to take it. On the
other hand, he may be retained in the home and employed permanently
as a driver on one of the wagons, or as overseer and
instructor in one of the rooms, or he may be sent out as assistant
to one of the stores, and, in time, he may be given charge of
a store. When the men first come to the home, they receive
board and clothing and some remuneration, although very slight.
If they continue to work at the home, they are paid wages ranging
from $1.00 per week up to $4.00 or $5.00 per week, besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>board and lodging in the United States, and from 1s. to 9s. in
England.</p>

<p>When a man is able, but is lazy and not willing to work, he
is turned out. It is well known to those who have studied the
question, that there are a large number of such men, but this
class does not apply for help as often as it might to the Army,
as it soon learns the uselessness of so doing. The officers become
quite adept in seeing these men in their true colors. On
the other hand, if a man drops into bad habits and goes off on
a spree after he has been helped, he will be taken in again afterwards,
and this is continued within reason. Much of the labor
employed is a surface and floating population, the result of season
and periodic work in connection with so many of our industries,
and the men are just tided over a hard time in their
experiences. This class is larger sometimes than at others, but
is always in evidence. Another class, however, consists of the
men who have fallen through their own recklessness and bad
habits. Some of these men are sent out to positions which they
fill creditably, and finally rise as high or higher than they were
before. Naturally, the Army makes as much as possible out of
these cases for the purpose of advertisement. Owing to evident
difficulties, it is impossible to ascertain just what percentage
there is of this class among the total number helped, or what
percentage of this class itself is successfully aided. The industrial
work itself, as a paying business, is developing so fast that a
constantly increasing number of men are permanently retained
and used as regular employees, being paid regular wages.</p>

<p>When we come to the industrial colony, we find it entirely
different from the farm colony, where families are sent to settle
upon the land in tracts of say twenty acres per family. The industrial
colony is managed like a large farm with many laborers,
all under one central head. The original idea was to graduate
men from the city plants to the industrial colonies and thence
to the farm colonies, but the Army has had difficulty in maintaining
its colonies at all, and, as a result, no regular system has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>been followed. A large proportion of the men on the industrial
colony are single, whereas, as will be seen, families are needed
for the farm colonies. Again, many of these men are not the
kind who will succeed on the farm colony. Sometimes, too, they
have not been through the city plant, and sometimes they are
men sent directly from the city to get them out of temptations
which are too strong for them.</p>

<p>The best example of an industrial colony is the one at Hadleigh,
about thirty miles from London, England. This colony
has an area of about 3,000 acres. One thousand acres is almost
useless now; and when taken by the Army in 1890, the whole consisted
of almost worthless land, some of which, as a result of
constant labor and fertilization, has been transformed into reasonably
good land. A great draw-back and a great expense
has been the lack of water, now partially supplied by two artesian
wells, the cheaper of which cost over $20,000.00.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The population
varies from 300 to 700.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In 1898, 775 men were
admitted to the colony. Out of this number, 193 left after a short
residence before they could be influenced for good; 47 were discharged
as incorrigible, and 309 graduated, obtaining situations
or being restored to their friends.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> There are three classes
received at the colony:</p>

<p>1. Those sent by the Army agencies.</p>

<p>2. Those sent by poor law authorities who pay from 5s. to 10s.
per week for periods of from three to twelve months for their
maintenance.</p>

<p>3. Special cases sent by philanthropic societies, or by relatives
or others.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Another division is made into four classes, thus:</p>

<p>1. Those coming and passing off in a month, not being regular
colonists.</p>

<p>2. Those averaging nine months on the colony, and called
colonists.</p>

<p>3. Picked men from the second class, who are made employees.</p>

<p>4. Employees hired in the neighborhood for specific purposes.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The proportion of each, according to either specification, is
such a variable quantity that nothing can be determined satisfactorily.
According to one officer's statement, about one in
every five is considered an employee.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In the winter of
1903-4, 209 men were sent to Hadleigh and supported there by
a special fund, called "The Mansion House Fund for the Relief
of the London Unemployed."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Out of the class sent by the
Army agencies to the colony, a certain number are sent out as
emigrants to Canada. For instance, in 1905, 41 were sent out,
and in 1906, 58. The party of 58 was composed of five Irishmen,
one Welshman, three Scotchmen, and forty-nine Englishmen.
These men go to work on different farms in Canada, and some
sent out in previous years now have homesteads there. In the
colony there are five departments, viz.: the market garden, the
brick-making department, the dairy department together with
the piggery, the poultry department, and the Inebriate's Home.
There is also a store which has an income of $1,000.00 a month.
The market garden is one of the best industries, most of the
produce being sold in the town of Southend, four miles distant.
In the busy season, as many as 100 workers are found in this
department. There are four large conservatories, especially for
tomatoes and flowers. A good many potatoes are raised, and
there is a good deal of land in berries and orchard. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>three brick-yards with the latest improved kilns and machinery.
These yards have been a very heavy expense and have not been
satisfactory. For instance, in 1898, the year's sale of bricks
amounted to £4717, while the expenditure of this department
was £5563, this latter sum including the expense of repairing
the drying fields, which that year were injured by a flood.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
In the dairy department about twenty-five head of cattle provide
the colony with milk and butter, while sometimes milk is sold at
Southend. In the piggery the number of hogs runs from 200
to 500. The poultry department is given over to prize poultry
breeding and has been successful in winning some noted prizes.
The Inebriate's Home is licensed for twenty male inebriates who
are charged from 25s. to 30s. per week. Between 60% and
70% are stated to be reclaimed after an average period of eight
months' treatment. In addition to these departments it might be
noted that there is a school on the colony with an attendance
of 100, some of whom come from outside the colony, and a good
sized hall, seating about 400, where gatherings are held for
social and religious purposes.</p>

<p>For the feeding and lodging of the colonists, large preparations
are made. They are graded according to their position in
the colony, and an opportunity is given them to rise from the
lower to the higher grades. The superintendent stated that this
plan was found useful in stimulating ambition. There are two
dormitories, both clean and well-kept, but the higher grade with
better bedding and surroundings than the lower. This grading
system is also maintained in the dining room, the higher grade
of colonists being served with better food than the lower. Everything
around the buildings is well-kept and orderly, and the general
moral atmosphere of the colony seems to be healthful and
up-lifting.</p>

<p>The industrial colony at Ft. Herrick, near Cleveland, Ohio,
differs in many ways from the one at Hadleigh, and doubtless has
been instrumental in aiding a good number of outcast and fallen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>men, but it has been such a burden financially, and such an
unsolved problem in many ways, that it may be considered a
failure. The reason for its failure is not so much bad management
as lack of foresight on the part of those choosing the site.
The site is in no sense suitable for a colony, the soil being unfit
for intensive farming. Probably the best work done there has
been the reformation of drunkards, a work in which, according
to reports, the colony has been eminently successful.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Coming now to the management of the Industrial Department
in the United States, we find that it is an up-to-date business
enterprise. The department is controlled by a corporation called
"The Salvation Army Industrial Homes Co." already referred to
in our <a href="#Introduction">introduction</a>.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The management of the company is in
the hands of the Army.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Under this central authority, we find
the United States divided into three districts; the eastern district,
with headquarters at New York; the central district with headquarters
at Cleveland, and the western district with headquarters
at Chicago. Each one of these districts has at its head a social
secretary, and under him are the different officers in charge of the
respective plants. Generally speaking, each local officer is
supreme in his individual plant. He can adopt methods and
means to suit the environment of his district, provided always
that his methods mean success. There are no iron-clad rules to
hold him in check beyond a system of bookkeeping and of making
out detailed reports, which must be sent to headquarters. When
about to engage in some new venture, however, such as securing
a new location for his plant, opening up a store, or renting or
purchasing new property, he must refer the project to his superior
officer, before undertaking it. The local officer in charge
has trusted employees under him, such as a warehouse boss, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>kitchen boss, and stable boss, etc., each of whom is responsible
to the officer for his department.</p>

<p>Although present to some extent in other countries the special
field of the industrial work is the United States. The growth in
this country during the recent years has been great. In 1896
there were no regular industrial homes; in 1904 there were 49
industrial institutions, and in control of these 49 institutions,
there were 70 Army officers and 820 regular employees. The
accommodation was about 1,100. During one month there were
225 cases that were considered unsatisfactory. There were 239
horses and wagons in daily use. About 1,000 tons of paper were
baled and sold per month. Contrast this with the year 1907. In
this year there were 84 officers engaged in these institutions and
over 1,200 regular employees. There was accommodation for
1,651 men. The unsatisfactory cases for the year amounted to
1,389. There were 460 horses and wagons in daily use. An
average of 2,500 tons of paper was sold each month. 16,875
men were placed in outside positions during the year. No large
city in the United States is without this industrial work, and it
is to be expected that, within a few years, there will be no city
in the country with a population of 100,000 that does not have an
industrial home, and that many cities with a smaller population
will have one also. Already there are several cities with a
population of less than 50,000 that have promising industrial
plants. In London, the growth has not been so rapid, and the
industrial institutions are run at a loss to the Army, but there are
about eight industrial plants in that city, and others are to be
found in other large cities of England.</p>

<p>We come now to the question of the value of the Salvation
Army industrial work to society. From the preceding brief outline
of the methods, material, labor, management and extent of
the industrial work, it will be seen that it is a movement, unrestricted
in scope, with an unlimited field of development as an
economic enterprise. In certain fields where the Army is active,
its work is considered of little or no value; but as a result of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>investigation into this particular field, the conclusion is reached
that, with the exception of the industrial colonies, it is a practical,
social work, of value to society.</p>

<p>We make an exception of the industrial colonies because we
do not consider that the two experiments already tried by the
Army justify their own continuance or the starting of other
similar colonies. The reference here is to Fort Herrick in Ohio,
and the Hadleigh Colony, near London. These colonies have
necessitated a continual sinking of funds contributed by the
charitable public, and the return does not justify their expense.
The Army should realize this, and admit the fact, instead of
drawing wool over the eyes of the ignorant public by the constant
reiteration of "the great work done at Hadleigh and Fort
Herrick." It looks as though the organization was afraid that
the infallibility and sanctity of General Booth's pet scheme would
be seriously impaired, if the public should discover that any part
of that scheme was a mistake and an unfortunate experiment,
and that, for this reason, it has continued to expend much
money on it, which might have been turned to better advantage
in connection with other parts of General Booth's plan. These
colonies are object lessons showing what is unwise to attempt,
rather than what can be done. The Army has no need to be
ashamed of having made a mistake, and its usefulness along
other lines is sufficient to maintain its reputation in spite of the
failure of its industrial colonies. There is no need of the
industrial colony anyway. The object in view is either to tide
workless men over a period of hard times and misfortune, or to
restore manhood where evil habits and recklessness have
destroyed it, and this can be done and is being done by means
of the city industrial work without the aid of the colony. As
regards the work of reforming the inebriate, in which the industrial
colonies have had some success, that could be carried on
without the great expense of a regular colony.</p>

<p>The moral field of the city industrial work derives support from
the relation of its management to the spiritual work and influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>of the Army. The influence and spirit of the whole organization
runs to a certain extent through every branch of its varied developments.
This influence cannot be described by comparative
means. The spirit, somewhat unique in itself, runs through
everything, a spirit which is a mixture and blending of love,
gratitude, service and patience. While we think that, in the
tendency of this branch to become a business enterprise, there is
a considerable decrease in the influence just described, it still has
great power. The officers and employees now engaged in this
work were themselves not long since outcasts in society. Many of
them had despaired of ever making a success of life and were
simply drifting. But a helping hand had been stretched out to
them, hope had been imparted and new ideals had been placed
before them. They might even yet be men, wear decent clothes,
stand up straight and look their fellow men in the eye! What
wonder that the decent clothes to which they looked forward
turned out to be the uniform of the organization which had picked
them up from the gutter! What wonder they felt an eternal debt
of gratitude toward that organization! While this is not a true
expression of their attitude in every case, and while there are
some who hold their positions simply because they can get no
better, loyalty to the work exists in enough instances to create a
distinct moral atmosphere. The men wish to make a success of
their new work; they wish to see the Army advance, and to do
this they feel that it is essential that the same moral influence
which enabled them to become men should be continued. This
influence moves almost unconsciously among the industrial plants.
For instance, we do not find here the tendency to obscenity which
we find in any ordinary factory or workshop. Environment in
these plants is all-powerful as an uplifting condition. Cleanliness
is encouraged in the dormitory and kitchen. Respectful
attention is paid at meals while grace is being said. The reading
room is frequented, while the occasional meetings held are sometimes
well attended and sometimes not, according to the attraction.
The emotional religious element is a great deal in evidence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>though not so much as in other departments of the Army. In
any case, the element of hope and ambition, which often arises
within these social outcasts, making them men once more, is to be
considered a great moral asset. The moral influence is due more
to the personality of those in charge than to anything else. A
large number of the managers have served in connection with
the Army's spiritual work and have the desire, as they would tell
you, to see every man under them "saved," not only in a moral
and social sense, but "saved" in accordance with the Army's
special significance of that term.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> While the Army's special
idea of salvation may have no value in itself, still if the emotional
element assists in the moral and social salvation of individuals,
we have no reason for not tolerating it unless it has
evil effects of real importance. Such effects, however, tend to
decrease, as the movement advances, and the education and
enlightenment of the masses increase.</p>

<p>From an economic point of view, we believe that the work of
the Industrial Department has been successful. We have seen
that large numbers of men, who are out of work, are taken in
by this department and kept for a number of weeks or months,
and that, during this time, besides making their own support, and
gaining in efficiency, in many cases, they are able to return to
a more important part in production. Let us see what this
means. While these men are out of work, they are not producing
anything. They are idle, and thus a loss to the community. In
addition, they are fast losing any potential ability for production,
which they have had. But they now become producers, a gain
to the community, and their potential ability for production is at
least conserved if not increased. Secondly, out-of-work men are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>a burden on the community. While they continue to live without
employment, they must be supported in some way or other by
private or public charity, and they form a great item of expense
to the community. But in the hands of the Industrial Department,
they cease being an expense to the public and become to
some extent a gain. Thirdly, some of these men are in danger of
becoming members of pseudo-social and anti-social classes; it is
from them that the pauper and criminal classes gain recruits.
But through the elevating environment of this branch of the
Army's work, their character is affected, and they are raised to a
higher level. In this way then, in successful cases, the worthless
men become workmen. Worthless men are changed into economic
assets. The dependents become independent. Working by means
of the laws of environment and association, the Army elevates
the degenerate from a pseudo-social and anti-social class to a
higher level and to social position. Where individuality was lost,
independence of character reasserts itself.</p>

<p>Let us consider in detail some of the advantages connected
with this form of practical philanthropy. One advantage is, that
once started, the work continues and increases without further
expenditure on the part of the charitably disposed public beyond
the giving away of things for which they have no further use.
This is so because the Army here in its work becomes an efficient
producer and creates articles which have market value.
Leaving all charity alone, the work is paying and more than self-supporting,
and thus in a short time will be reimbursed with all
the money which was necessary to initiate it. In nearly every
city in which the work was started, rented property soon gives
place to property owned by the Army and poor ill-suited buildings,
to up-to-date structures built for the purpose. An example
of this is to be found in the history of the 48th Street Industrial
Home in New York City which is briefly described, in the examples
given <a href="#Page_36">at the end of this chapter</a>.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> That the entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>work has grown self-supporting in the United States is shown
by the fact that last year, 1907, there was a net gain of $21,000,
after the interest on the loans and investments had been paid. If
a home does not show signs of being successful financially, its
location will be changed or it will be discontinued.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Another advantage lies in the fact that men who were
socially dependent are made self-supporting. We should place
emphasis on the effect on the man himself as well as on the
community. We saw how these men were given to understand
that they were earning their own livelihood and were not
recipients of charity, and how they were encouraged by the
receipt of wages, to be increased as their productiveness increased.
The relief given is true relief in that the man earns it himself and
realizes this fact, and because, along with this realization, comes
a return of manhood and independence. Of course if men have
lost all manhood and have no desire to be independent, but simply
to live as easily as possible on what may be given them, the above
is not the result; but few such get into the industrial homes, as
they know better and have no wish to work as these men do, and
if they get in temporarily, they are soon sorted out. Thus it cannot
be said of these homes as is said of many institutions, that
they pauperize men in place of helping them. The institution
that makes men work for everything they get and provides
some sort of channel for their ambition, maintaining itself meanwhile
as a paying concern, is not pauperizing in its tendency.</p>

<p>Still another advantage of this work is found in the saving
of the community's funds. Of late years, more and more, the
principle has been advanced and brought before the public, that
the starving and unemployed are to be cared for in some way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>and we are willing to tax ourselves to provide for this. As far
back as the census of 1890, we find that the United States spent
annually $40,000,000 in charities and over $12,000,000 in penal
and reformatory institutions. Probably the total expenditure for
these two objects to-day would be nearer $60,000,000 annually.
What percentage of this $60,000,000 would go to the class of
people aided by the Army industrial work would be hard to ascertain
or approximate, but there is room for a great extension of
this kind of work, and the Army's efforts are most suggestive.
In some of the European countries, especially Germany, many
helpful experiments along this line are in progress, but conditions
in the United States are vastly different. In any case
social economists are agreed that vast sums are spent annually
in our country to little or no purpose from the point of view of
social relief. In the year 1907, 8,696 men were cared for in the
United States industrial homes of the Army. This means just
that amount of saving to the nation that it would have cost the
regular municipal and state charities to have dealt with these
8,696 men, since these men were aided by a self-supporting
organization and paid for their own support. This work, then,
if carried far enough, would effect quite a saving of taxes.</p>

<p>But along with advantages there may be disadvantages. Some
objections have been raised to this branch of the Army's work.
For instance, it is stated that industries entered into by the Army
tend to hurt economic conditions with regard to both wages and
prices.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> With regard to wages it is urged that the Army will
keep for its industries, workers in constraint of one kind or another,
paying them a lower wage than the same workers could
procure outside, and thus lowering the wages in the respective
industries. We do not consider this objection a strong one.
Let us forget for the present the philanthropic side of the industrial
work, and look on it as a distinctly economic enterprise,
as a factor of production. We think it quite likely that a
manager, anxious above everything else to make his institution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>a financial success, would make an endeavor to keep as long
as possible, and at as low wages as possible, men who could
receive more on the outside. He might even try to retain men
for whom he could secure better positions through the employment
bureau, if he needed their services, and times were so good
that no other applicant offered to take their place, but this he
could not succeed in doing to any serious extent; for, in the first
place, the restraint exercised over the men is very slight, and
secondly, if the men could secure better wages, it would not be
long before they found it out and left the home voluntarily. It
would be just the same as in any industry in which most of the
workers are ignorant. They would remain under low wages
just as long as their ignorance and lack of initiative would allow,
but sooner or later the relatively able man would seek the best
wage. Hence the able man would seek the best wage, and his
place would be taken by one, possibly morally and physically
unable to procure any wage, or, in other words, belonging to the
unemployable class. If it should come to the point of the Army's
hiring able men to carry on the work without aiding the outcasts,
it must compete in the market for them and pay the market
price. The only real danger would lie in the Army's industrial
work securing a strong enough position in some industry to be
able to dictate terms to labor in an industry, but this is so unlikely
as to be almost irrelevant and even in such an almost inconceivable
case, the danger would be only temporary. Labor would
still be able to drift sufficiently to another agency, not controlled
by the Army and thus bring up wages again. This is the more
true in that any industry, in which the Army engages, must of
necessity be one in which unskilled labor is competent.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In
addition to this, from personal investigation, we can state that
a large part of the labor employed in these plants of the Army
is at any rate temporarily inefficient labor and would not have
much chance in securing employment elsewhere. Finally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>though considered a charitable work, this branch of the army is,
as already stated, a corporation, a business enterprise financed by
investors who receive interest on their investments; hence, to
the same extent that it is a financial enterprise, like other such
enterprises, it will be governed by the rate of wages.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Another objection has been raised by critics, to the effect that
the Army, through its industry, enters into competition with existing
firms and companies to the harm of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> For
instance they urge that in the case of those engaged in second-hand
goods and salvage, who are able to make a profit by buying
their material, the army enters into an unfair competition, when
it takes such material, given in charity, and sells at a lower
figure. In so far as the army does undersell others this objection
is valid, and we have no doubt that in some cases such is the
truth. Doubtless some individuals and firms have been hurt in
their business by this under-selling. For instance, in Chicago,
the Army has nine retail stores situated in the poorer districts,
doing a big business in second hand goods. In addition to those
goods it sends into the retail trade, it sells hundreds of tons of
paper and rags annually. This must have some effect on others
engaged in this business. However, the Army itself sometimes
pays for its material and does not often undersell.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>is another side to this question of underselling. Naturally the
tendency is to get as much as possible for its goods, and provided
there is a market, the army would seek to obtain just as much as
any one else in the business. It now falls back on a question of
supply and demand. The only way in which the price would be
lowered by the Salvation Army would be by an increase of supply.
Doubtless the supply of these goods is increased by the thorough
work of the Army agents, and, to such an extent, its entrance
into this field would tend to lower prices. However, in the leading
salvage industries of the army, the increase in supply does no
more than offset the increase in demand. The amount of displacement
of the salvage and allied industries due to the competition
of the army at present would not seem to be much,
although of course it is difficult to get any exact figures along this
line.</p>

<p>Looking at the Salvation Army retail store as a form of relief,
another question arises as to whether the opportunity given to
the residents of the district to get things at the Salvation Army's
store cheaper than elsewhere interferes with the standard of
living. By the standard of living we mean the scale or measure
of comfort and satisfaction which a person or a community of
persons regards as indispensable to happiness.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This would
differ in the case of different persons and classes and communities,
but progress demands that the standard should never
be lowered, but should always be raised, in accord with increasing
enlightenment and education.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is only," says Dr. Devine, "when individuals or individual
families for personal or exceptional or temporary reasons fall
below the standard, that charitable assistance can effectively intervene.
In other words, as has been pointed out in other connections,
the relieving policy cannot be made to raise the general
standard of living, but it should be so established as not to depress
it"<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p><p>Here, then, the point is, whether those who are otherwise able
to come up to the standard of living in a given community take
advantage of this form of charity, or whether the customers of the
Salvation Army's stores are living below that standard. To just
the extent that the former is true, this part of the work would be
pauperizing and retrogressive, but we do not consider the
former to be true. Naturally, we have no statistics on this
point, but speaking from general observation, we should say
that the customers of these stores are needy poor, who are living
below the standard, and hence, the store is a boon to them in
aiding them toward a realization of that standard.</p>

<p>Let us now sum up our conclusions regarding the industrial
work of the Army. Regarding the industrial colonies, we would
say that, while doubtless responsible for good and reformation
in certain cases, nevertheless, owing to their cost of maintenance
and the fact that the work can be done without them, they are
not a practical form of charity deserving the intelligent support
of the public. Regarding the city industrial work, including the
employment, amid a good environment, of men out of work, including
also the turning of much otherwise waste matter into
an economic good, and the assistance of deserving poor by means
of second-hand stores, we would say that it is commendable and
deserving of support. This latter conclusion is made in spite of
three objections: first, that there is a tendency to lower wages,
which objection we do not consider as important for reasons
given; second, that underselling of certain commodities by the
Army takes place, which objection we admit to a limited extent,
and third, that the standard of living is interfered with, which
objection we do not consider valid.</p>



<h3><br />Examples of Men in the Army Industrial Homes.</h3>

<p>These examples were collected by Mr. Jas. Ward at the two
industrial homes situated on West 19th Street and West 48th
Street, New York City, during the months of March and April,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>1908. Mr. Ward worked right with the men whose cases are
given here, and slept in the homes, thus being with them night
and day. The home on West 19th Street was an old milk depot
rented temporarily by the Army to aid the unemployed during
the winter, and had accommodation for two hundred men.
Everything was very crude. The men slept on the floor, some
without blankets. They were required to work from three to five
hours every day, and during the rest of the day, they were
allowed to go out and seek for work. The best of these men
were drafted out to fill the vacancies in the regular industrial
homes of the Army as they occurred. On the other hand, the
home on West 48th Street was and is one of the Army's best
homes, built for the purpose by the Army in 1907, at a cost of
$130,000.00. Everything here is arranged for comfort and cleanliness.
The dormitory is of the best, with good ventilation and
other sanitary conditions. It is a seven-story building, and has
accommodation for one hundred and seventy-five men. Twenty-two
wagons are sent out from this home every day. In every way
it is a contrast with the West 19th Street home, hence the
examples will show some difference, according to which home
they refer.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Salvation Army Hotels and Lodging Houses.</span></h2>


<p>In a study of environment and its effects on the lowest classes
of our great cities, the cheap lodging house affords a favorable
field. Here we have crowding, unsanitary conditions, immoral
atmosphere, and all the attendant evils. A good description of
such lodging houses in New York City has been given by
Jacob Riis, in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the caravansaries that line Chatham Street and the Bowery,
harboring nightly a population as large as that of many a thriving
town, a home-made article of tramp and thief is turned out that is
attracting the increasing attention of the police, and offers a field
for the missionary's labors, besides which most others seem of
slight consequence"<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p></div>

<p>The cheap lodging houses of London and other great cities
are similar in their environment and effects. This field was
early entered by the Army. It was necessary that a very low
rate of cost for the individual concerned be maintained because
of competition with the lodging houses already existing, and
because of the size of the prospective lodger's purse. The first
experiments were tried in London. There, at first, the primary
aim was to aid the needy and destitute, but later the Army entered
into a competition with the existing lodging houses and
paid more attention to the element of environment. It was
soon definitely proved that such a work could be carried on
to advantage, that shelter amid beneficial surroundings, could be
provided to those almost destitute, and that the work could
be self-supporting. Since then this work has extended to nearly
all the larger cities of Europe and America, but it is of greatest
extent in England and the United States. Along with this
growth there has been differentiation. The hotels have been
graded to suit the requirements of the different classes to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>they appeal: the almost destitute class, and those who have
steady employment. Hence, besides treating of conditions common
to both, we shall describe special features of two grades of
both men's and women's hotels.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The location for a men's hotel must be determined partly
by its propinquity to the class of men which it is seeking to
attract and partly for facilities for ventilation, cleanliness and
general sanitary conditions. These last features are of the greatest
importance in this work. Led by the real need of the
case, and working with regard to its reputation, the Army has,
in this respect, shown a great advance over the general cheap
lodging houses. Still, there is room for improvement in the
Army hotels.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> One great difficulty lies in the lodgers,
many of whom are so habituated to uncleanliness in general,
that it is with great reluctance on their part that they are induced
to cleanliness. Especially in the lower class hotels is this
true where the rough, brutal element finds its way. Another
difficulty lies in the fact that the Army frequently takes old
buildings and turns them into hotels, when they are not suitable
for the purpose. A favorable tendency to overcome this, however,
lies in the Army's desire to put up new buildings fitted
for hotels, and this is being done in many cities.</p>

<p>In both the higher and the lower class men's hotels, the general
plan is to have two or three grades of sleeping apartments.
The first grade is in the form of dormitories, where each dormitory
will contain from ten to fifty beds in the smaller hotels,
and from fifty to one hundred and even two hundred beds in
the larger.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> For a bed in one of these dormitories, 10c
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>and 15c per night is charged in the United States, and in England
2d up. This includes the use of a locker beside the bed,
with sometimes a nightgown, and sometimes a bath. The
second grade of lodging is in individual rooms, partitioned off,
but inside rooms, for which the charge is 15c in the United
States, and 4d to 6d in England. Then finally we have the third
grade of lodging, which consists of individual rooms which have
outside windows, and for which the price varies from 20c to
50c per night according to situation and furnishing.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Sometimes
the three grades of lodging are found on the same floor, a
part of the floor being dormitory, and a part partitioned off into
rooms, the partitions running up to a height of eight or nine
feet. This method of partitioning off the rooms is almost
universal. It is cheap and to some extent sanitary, since by
means of windows at either end of the building a continual
current of air can be maintained all over the floor. In most
of the higher class hotels one floor is given up to dormitories
and another to individual rooms, while the majority of lower
class hotels consist entirely of dormitories. Hotels are of all
sizes, and run from one floor up to eight or ten.</p>

<p>The beds found in the Army hotels are iron, with mattresses
usually covered with American cloth or some form of leather,
but sometimes with strong canvas.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Each bed is provided
with pillow, sheets, a coverlid, and sometimes an additional
counterpane. The individual rooms, in addition to having
better beds, contain a looking glass, a chair, a small table,
and other furnishings according to the price of the room. In
most cases washing facilities are only found in the lavatory,
common to the whole floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p><p>Comparative cleanliness is enforced at all grades of hotels.
Baths are sometimes made compulsory, though often this rule
cannot be rigidly enforced. Usually each floor is provided with
bath tubs and shower baths. Nearly every hotel has a fumigating
room, an air tight apartment filled with racks, upon which
clothing is hung. If a man's appearance or clothing looks suspicious
in any way, his clothes are placed in a sack with a number
corresponding to the number of his bed or room, and hung
in the fumigating room over night. Early the next morning
his clothes will be returned to him. The dormitories and rooms
themselves, every few days, receive a fumigating and cleaning.
Thus, except in very rare cases, no fault can be found with
the cleanliness of the Army hotels. We hardly ever visited any
of them without coming into contact with the scent of fumigation,
or finding some individual working with mop and broom.</p>

<p>The above description, except where stated differently, fits
both classes of men's hotels. The higher class, intended for
transients of the better class of poor and for workmen with
steady employment, has some distinctive features. In addition
to better equipment along the line of furnishings, lavatories, etc.,
this class of hotels necessarily has a better social environment
than the other. For instance, there are many lower class hotels
where the reading room is dark, poorly furnished, without attractive
reading matter, and where it serves as smoking room
as well as reading room. While this might be improved, yet
so low are the occupants that such improvement would not be
appreciated. But when we come to the higher grade hotels,
we find a difference. Take, for example, the Army Hotel in
the city of Cleveland, O., on the corner of Eagle and Erie
Streets. This corner building was built by the Army to answer
its purpose, at a cost of $100,000.00. There are no dormitories
in the building. The three upper floors are given over
to the hotel, which comprises 130 rooms, each room being steam
heated and electric lighted, and each floor being reached by
elevators. Bathing facilities and sanitary arrangements are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>first class. A comfortable reading room and lounging room is
provided for general use, where there are popular magazines,
daily papers and writing conveniences. As another example,
about the highest grade Army institution of this class is found
in Boston, and is called "The People's Palace." It is a large,
five-story, corner building, built by the Army for the purpose.
In this institution the social environment is especially emphasized.
There is a reading room, a smoking room, one or
more social parlors, a gymnasium with a swimming tank, and
an auditorium with a seating capacity of 600. The whole
building, with its 287 single rooms, besides the above advantages,
is equipped with steam heat, electric service and other
modern conveniences. A special fee of 25c is charged for the
use of the gymnasium and swimming tank, but the other advantages
are free to lodgers. In this way, it is seen that the
higher class hotels have more opportunity for a good social
environment and for social work. We think that the addition
of certain features, such as men's clubs, smokers, popular
lectures, etc., would be of great advantage to this class of institutions.
To overcome the difficulty of a transient population,
however, would require considerable ingenuity.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Along the line of religious environment we find the hotels
differ a great deal. In London there seems to be a strong influence
of this kind, most of the hotels of both classes holding
gospel meetings frequently. For instance, at the Quaker Street
Elevator Home, which is partly a hotel and partly an industrial
home, meetings are held nearly every night with good attendance,
and at the Burne Street Hotel well attended meetings are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>held every night except Wednesdays and Saturdays, these
nights being given over to the men for washing their clothes.
But in the United States we find, as a rule, that the Salvation
Army hotels are run with very little religious influence. In a
few cases, meetings are held regularly, but more often no provision
is made for them. Meetings are generally in progress
somewhere in the neighborhood at the regular Army corps, and
the men are left to attend these meetings if they wish. Generally
they are willing to take advantage of the hotel, but do not care
for the sentimental form of religion preached by the Army.
Hence, in most of the hotels, we find the religious influence
limited to the texts on the walls, and to the attitude of the
employees, who are not always Salvationists or converted men.</p>

<p>Some hotels of both classes are fitted with a kitchen and
lunch counter. This is nearly always the case in London, where
the hotels have a counter, over which the food is sold, and
then taken to a seat by the purchaser. In several cases the
counter is divided so that it opens into different rooms, and
there are two grades of prices, the lower price being paid for
food somewhat damaged and stale.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>We need not dwell long on the subject of the women's
hotels, as that does not form an important part of the Army's
work. The women's hotels, even more than the men's, have
tended to fall into two classes. There is a great difference between
the hotel for women who are almost destitute, and the
hotel for respectable working girls, who have positions as clerks
and stenographers, and who happen to have no home of their
own. A typical hotel of the former class is situated near the
Dearborn Street Railway Depot in Chicago. It consists of
three floors, and has accommodation for fifty girls or women.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>The woman officer in charge lives here herself, and seeks to
have an environment as homelike as possible. She states, however,
that occasionally the women come in noisily and are
troublesome. There is a great difference between one woman
and another, and she wishes she had one floor with better accommodation
than the rest for the better element among them.
The price paid per bed at this hotel is 10 cents. A good example
of this class of hotel in England, is the one situated on Hanbury
Street, Whitechapel, London, where there are three floors, two
upper floors given over to dormitories containing 276 beds in all,
and the ground floor containing a dining room, kitchen, small hall,
and office. Here, women are turned away quite often because
of lack of room. 2d. is charged for a bed, and for food a scale
of prices, such as tea, &frac12;d.&mdash;soup, &frac12;d.&mdash;bread, &frac12;d.&mdash;etc. There
are nine officers working here, and nine other workers, six of the
latter receiving 3s. per week, and three receiving 1s. per week.</p>

<p>With the higher class hotels for women, the Army has not had
much success. This is easily understood, as the respectable girl
does not like to be connected with a hotel run by an organization
which is prominent for its slum and rescue work. These hotels
charge a higher rate for rooms and are situated in a good quarter
of the city.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> They are frequented by shop girls, bookkeepers,
clerks and stenographers. Apparently, no great religious pressure
is brought to bear on the girls and women, but this would
probably depend on the officer in charge.</p>

<p>The growth of the Hotel Department of the Army's work, like
that of the Industrial Department, has, of recent years, been
great. Soon after the publication in 1890 of General Booth's
book, "Darkest England," the hotel work was started in England,
and its progress has been rapid. In the United States at first
the work did not make much headway. When Commander
Booth-Tucker came to take charge in 1896, there were three
small men's hotels situated in the cities of Buffalo, San Francisco,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>and Seattle. At the present time, nearly every large city in
England and the United States has one or more of these hotels,
the latter country having 71 men's hotels and 4 women's hotels,
with a total accommodation of 8,688. The tendency now is
toward fewer of the lower class hotels, and more of the higher
class; in other words, toward fewer hotels where beds can be
had for 10c and 15c, and more where they will cost 20c and
25c. The Army gives as its reason for this the fact that the
cheaper hotel cannot be maintained in a wholesome manner and
be self-supporting.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Similar to the Industrial Department in its
management, the Hotel Department has its divisions, its graded
officers with their various responsibilities, and its head officer in
charge at the national headquarters. In the United States, however,
unlike the Industrial Department, the Hotel Department
has no separate financial company, in the form of a corporation,
behind it. In some instances, deserving men are given bed
tickets and meal tickets free, by officers detailed for the purpose,
and, to that extent the hotels are a charity. This is done with
due discretion and does not make an appreciable difference. The
amount of charity indulged in by the Army in this way is, however,
probably responsible for the fact that in 1907, there was a
loss to the Army in this department of $4,500.00, not a very large
amount, considering the number of hotels concerned.</p>

<p>Coming to the value of the Army hotels from the point of
view of the social economist, care must be taken to discriminate
between their commercial and their philanthropic aspects. The
public has a mistaken idea of the work carried on by this branch
of the Army. Many people have an idea that thousands of homeless,
starving men and women are nightly taken care of in these
Army hotels. Putting aside the question whether such would
be good relief policy or not, the statement itself is not true. In
a majority of cases the man or woman in order to gain admittance
must have the price, and in many instances, that price
will also admit them to the regular cheap lodging house outside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>of the Army. We are not finding fault with the system of
charging, since from the point of view of true relief, provided
that bona-fide, destitute cases are not left without help, the
price should be required, as it would be a great evil to throw
open the hotels to the crowds of regular beggars and social parasites
who constantly throng any institution supposed to be charitable;
but since the Army hotel movement claims to be a self-supporting
business, it is not to be regarded as different from
any other lodging business, except in those points in which
it excels the other. With this caution we believe that we still
can distinguish two lines along which credit is to be given the
Army. The first is the environment which the Army has created
for its guests. It is not necessary here to show what a great
factor environment is in this case, but simply to emphasize its
importance. From our description of the Army hotel, it is
seen that, with certain exceptions, the Army maintains cleanliness,
cheerfulness, and a homelike atmosphere around its lodging
houses.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In this important respect then, the Army hotel is to
be commended. Secondly, the Army has indirectly, by its competition
with the ordinary cheap lodging houses, led them to adopt
improvement for purely commercial reasons. If a man has only
ten cents, he is going to invest that ten cents to the best advantage,
and the old time lodging houses have found it necessary
to improve their conditions in order to meet the competition of
the Army. For this too, credit is to be given the latter. In
addition the competition reacts on the Army and tends to make it
keep up its own standard.</p>

<p>In order more clearly to discuss the advantages and disadvantages
of cheap lodging houses, whether Army hotels or not,
it would be well here to consider objections to their existence.
Three objections have been raised to all cheap lodging houses in
general.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That they herd together a low class of vagrants and vicious
characters.</p>

<p>2. That their cheapness lowers the standard of living.</p>

<p>3. That they encourage the youth of the country to come to
the city and live in comparative idleness.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>No one who has looked into the matter has any doubt about
the accuracy of the first objection. One glance at the faces of
a group of men in the smoking room of any such hotel reveals
many of the low, bestial, criminal type; many victims of dissipation
and many who have acquired a dislike for work of any sort.
This harboring of the vicious element is also true of the Army
hotels of the lower class, but it is in company with this element
that we find the men for whom more or less can be done.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The second objection must be considered more carefully. To
repeat the definition of the standard of living which was discussed
in connection with the Industrial Department, it is the
scale or measure of comfort and satisfaction, which a person or
community of persons, regards as indispensable to happiness.
Now the question is whether these cheap lodging houses lower
this standard; whether their existence results in a tendency to
live with less effort and less ambition, and thus renders men and
women less productive and less proficient. This question must
be separated into a question regarding the community as a whole,
and a question regarding the individual. As regards the
standard of living of any single community, the answer would be
that the standard is not appreciably lowered by this hotel system,
since the occupants are mostly single men wandering around, and
the standard of living of the community is more concerned with
the maintenance of homes in its midst, than of transients. This,
however, brings in the further question as to whether the cheap
living made possible by the lodging houses leads to the breaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>up of homes, since if it does so, it would bear decidedly on the
standard of living. We would answer this second question in the
negative, because life in the cheap hotel is not such a desirable
thing as to lead to the breaking up of homes. A man has already
left home and is already reduced in circumstances, before the
fact of such cheap living as the hotels and cheap restaurants of
the Bowery in New York, or of Whitechapel in London, ever
comes to him as an advantage. But, on the other hand, when it
comes to the individual concerned, we think that the standard is
lowered and that in many cases the objection holds good. For
instance, take a man with a regular trade, say bricklaying or
carpentering. He is thrown out of work and gradually drifts
down to the cheap hotel. For months, possibly, he strives in
vain to get work at his trade. He exists, however, by means of
odd jobs picked up at random; he becomes shiftless; the life which
consists of so much "hanging around" and loafing, decreases his
efficiency, and, in this way, his standard is lowered. At the same
time his character is affected, and even if no worse development
takes place, he loses ambition, and that lowers his standard.
Hence, in conclusion, we would say that the objection that the
hotel movement of the Army leads to a lowering of a standard
of living has no place as regards the community, but is sustained
as regards individuals.</p>

<p>The third objection that the country youth are induced by this
cheap living to leave for the city is not a strong one and needs
but short notice. Some of the most successful men of our cities
come from the country, but very few of the lower and pauper
classes. This has been shown by the investigations of Mr. Fox
in England, and by our own investigations in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The consideration of these objections leads us to a closer examination
of the class of men frequenting the hotels of the Army.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>The men's work being so much larger, let us look at the occupants
of the men's hotels. Here we must separate the comparatively
few hotels of the higher class, which, charging higher prices and
harboring the working man, have a different environment from
the others. In these, the higher class, we see a competition with
the ordinary boarding and lodging houses which single men
frequent, a competition which, owing to the more healthful social
environment of the Army hotel, is to be welcomed and approved
of as a preventive of vice and degradation. The latter is often the
result of crowded, uncleanly, workingmen's lodgings, which drive
their occupants to the saloon. But the majority of the Army
hotels are filled with the lowest class of men, out of any steady
employment. This class is composed for the most part and under
present conditions, of men who are almost helpless cases.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Conditions can be conceived which would result in the betterment
of a certain percentage of these, but a large number would
always be hopeless. Many have been given their chances and have
thrown them away; some have had no chances, and some could
not use them if they had. Many are physical and moral wrecks.
In their faces you see no ambition. They simply exist as do
animals. For such, except in unusual cases, there is no remedy.
Do all you can for them, and they will slide back again; give them
work, and if they are willing to take it at all, they soon lose their
positions. Some belong to the pseudo-social class and are mere
parasites feeding on society. Others are anti-social, bitter and
criminal.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>These men are not those with which the Army is successful, in
its industrial institutions, although many of them have been tried.
They secure their ten cents or fifteen cents for a bed in a cheap
hotel by any means which comes along. They form a class, which
especially in the older countries of Europe and increasingly in the
new world, presents a problem that is the great puzzle of the
statesman and the social economist alike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p><p>The present tendency of the Army already mentioned to have
fewer of the lower class, cheap hotels and more of the higher class
brings up some important considerations. There are three
points which come up for particular notice here. First, as
has already been stated, the present tendency of the Army is to
have fewer of the lower class or cheap hotels and more of the
higher class. One reason for this is that, although the Army's
competition has in many instances forced the ordinary cheap
hotels to better their equipment, still, in the long run, the Army
cannot successfully compete with the ordinary low class hotel
and maintain an equally good or better environment, without
having its hotel work subsidized by the public. The men whom
we have just described do not appreciate better surroundings
sufficiently to pay fifteen cents for a bed at the Army hotel,
when they can get one for ten cents at another place around the
corner. Secondly, as the Army extends its work, there is the
ever present tendency of any organization to become an end in
itself. Hence the Army tends to forsake its field of the lower
class for the field of the working class for financial reasons. If
it can carry on a hotel which appeals to a higher class of working
men who are willing to pay $1.50 upwards per week for a
separated room such as has been described, they may do better
financially than with a dormitory whose beds are held at ten
cents. This second point of consideration leads us to a third,
and that is, what is to become of this lower class of vagrants and
unemployables. This discussion hardly comes in the scope of
this book, but we might suggest in passing that the cheap, lower
class of hotels with which the Army has entered into competition
should not be allowed to continue as at present. In case of the
failure to provide competition, the city itself should provide a
successful competition under good environment, or should take
measures for the segregation of the vicious elements of the population
from the merely weak, aged and unfortunate.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p><p>On the other hand, among the occupants of these hotels a
certain number are men for whom there is hope; some victims of
misfortune; others degraded by dissipation and recklessness, but
not entirely demoralized. With these the Army can deal successfully
in its industrial homes, and some of them can regain a foothold
without aid. For these men the Army hotel is certainly a
boon.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> A man who has not lost ambition and who can gather
a few cents a day to sustain him, until some temporary difficulty is
past is glad to take advantage of such an institution. Finally, regarding
this class as a whole, something must be done with them,
and it is necessary for those who find fault with their congregation
in the Army hotels, to point out a better way of caring for
them. As long as they exist, they will tend to congregate somewhere,
and until some better solution is offered, we might as well
take what is at hand, and if it is the Army hotel, hold that institution
to its best efforts and its best environment.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, our conclusions of this part of the Army's
work, we find that the hotels are commercial enterprises, with,
as a rule, an environment superior to the regular cheap hotels
of the same price, and that although there is an objection to
the congregation of the vicious and vagrant along with the unfortunate,
and although there may be a tendency to lower the
standard of living of these people, individually considered, yet
there is a justification for the existence of these hotels, as
something must be done with this class of people, and this is
the best solution offered, inasmuch as a certain percentage of
this class is really aided and tided over temporary difficulty.
At the same time, there remains the need of the segregation of
the class concerned, with a more scientific, practical, individual
treatment. Better work can be done along this line.</p>

<h3><br /><span class="smcap">Examples of Salvation Army Hotel Lodgers.</span></h3>

<p>A collection of 76 cases made on seventeen different evenings
during the months of March and April, 1908, at two of
the Salvation Army hotels, both situated on the Bowery in New
York City, one being a lower class hotel and the other a combination
of lower and higher class. These cases were collected at
first hand by the author and a friend of the author, Mr. James
Ward, both of whom mingled among the men in the disguise of
working men. In this way the facts were gained without much
difficulty, with the exception of information regarding the family
of the man concerned. Sometimes, therefore, this latter information
is lacking.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Farm Colonies of the Salvation Army.</span></h2>


<p>So many times has the cry been raised "back to the land!", so
optimistic have so many reformers become over the hope that
the population could be diverted from the city to the country,
and so loudly have certain enthusiasts prophesied a surely successful
issue to colonizing enterprises, that the Salvation Army
colonies form a very interesting and profitable field of investigation.
What is needed is an experiment that will prove or disprove
the prophesied success of taking the people back to the
land. Once that is proved, with the great Northwest of America
almost untouched, with immense tracts of good land in
Africa and other continents, and with the United States about to
open up millions of acres of land, made fertile by means of irrigation,
we shall be ready to act and get rid of the surplus city
population. But first we must have the proof, and the question
before us is whether the Salvation Army has sufficiently proved
the case.</p>

<p>The matter was agitated before the English Government to
such an extent in 1905 that the Rhodes Trustees, contributing
sufficient funds to cover the expense, the Secretary of State for
the Colonies nominated Mr. Rider Haggard, the novelist, to visit
the United States and inspect the three Salvation Army colonies
there, to make a report on the same, and to include in this report
any practical suggestions which might occur to him. The following
words were used in the letter of commission: "It appears
to the Secretary of State that if these experiments are found to
be successful, some analogous system might to great advantage be
applied in transferring the urban population of the United Kingdom
to different parts of the United Kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Haggard visited the three colonies in the United States,
and made a report to the English Government, favoring strongly
the movement, and recommending that the Government take it
up, provide the capital and utilize all ready existing organizations,
such as the Salvation Army, in carrying out its scheme.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>The matter was referred by the Government to the Departmental
Committee, who, after reviewing it and looking into the question
in 1906, issued a long report in which they discountenanced Mr.
Haggard's scheme on the ground that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. It was better for settlers from England to be scattered
about with experienced farmers as neighbors than to be
placed in a number together.</p>

<p>2. The Salvation Army or any similar organization was
not a desirable management for a colony dependent on
money advanced by the Imperial Government.</p>

<p>3. That Ft. Romie and Ft. Amity, the American farm colonies
of the Salvation Army, were not precedents upon
which a large scheme of colonization could be based.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p></div>

<p>The Committee gave reasons for arriving at the above conclusions,
into which, for the present, we need not enter, but
their conclusions are suggestive, and may be borne in mind while
we make our study of the subject.</p>

<p>Gen. Booth, in his plans as outlined in "Darkest England,"
provided for three main divisions of the work for the unemployed
poor, viz., the City Colony, the Country Colony and the
Over-sea Colony, signifying by these terms the City Industrial
Work, the Country Industrial Colony, and the Farm Colony.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
The last named was to be on a larger scale on some Colonial
territory of England. This division has tended to persist in the
United States, and this country has been the field for special
experiments along this line. There are three Colonies in the
United States: Fort Herrick, situated near Cleveland, Ohio;
Fort Amity, situated in Southeast Colorado, and Ft. Romie,
which is located at Soledad in the Salinas Valley, California.
At first there was no differentiation between these Colonies, but
latterly, the Colony at Ft. Herrick, the smallest of the three, has
been managed as an Industrial Colony, and the other two have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>continued as regular Farm Colonies. The plan of "Commander"
Booth-Tucker, in charge of the Salvation Army in the United
States from 1896 until 1904, and the originator of these Colonies,
was, in brief, as he states it, to take the waste labor in families,
and place it upon the waste land by means of waste capital,
and thereby to convert this trinity of waste into a unity of production.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
His waste labor was the family struggling in the
crowded city; his waste land, the large tracts of public land
about to be opened up by irrigation; and his waste capital, if
such a term can be used, was the capital lying idle, or at least,
making 2&frac12; or 3 per cent., when according to his estimate, it
could yield 5 per cent. The principles which he laid down were
as follows:</p>


<p>1. There must be sufficiency of capital.</p>

<p>2. The land must be carefully selected and laid out.</p>

<p>3. The colonists must be well selected.</p>

<p>4. There must be able supervision.</p>

<p>5. The principle of home ownership must be followed.</p>

<p>6. God must be recognized.</p>

<p>From our investigations at Ft. Romie and Ft. Amity, we
arrived at the conclusion that No. 4 and No. 6 were the only
ones thoroughly carried out; that there was a weakness in the
amount of capital (Prin. No. 1); that an unfortunate selection of
land was made (Prin. No. 2); that the successful colonists did
not entirely represent the class from which we should wish them
to be taken (Prin. No. 3); and that ownership gave way largely
to a system of renting-out by the Army (Prin. No. 5). For
verification of this, see the typical cases at the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>Commander Booth-Tucker advanced the argument, which is
sound, to the effect that, when entire families were taken from
the city and placed on the land, the tendency to return to the city
would be overcome. It has been the experience of philanthropists,
that when single men and women were transferred from the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>to the country, they always tended to return, the reason being
due to an acquired fondness of the individual for intimate association
with his fellows,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> but when a man has his wife and
children, together with a plot of land and a home which he may
call his own, the attraction toward the city is overcome, by a
stronger one which keeps him where he is. Of course, this would
answer for the one generation only.</p>

<p>Leaving out the small colony at Ft. Herrick, Ohio, which was
changed to an Industrial Colony, and which is considered in the
chapter on the Industrial Work, let us examine more closely the
Farm Colonies at Ft. Amity, Col., and Ft. Romie, Cal. The
larger enterprise was set on foot in Colorado, in 1898, where a
tract of 2,000 acres was secured at a cost of $46,000.00. In this
year, fourteen families were brought from Chicago and placed
on the bare, unimproved prairie, where, however, there was
abundant water supply carried by a large irrigation company.
These colonists were all family men with two exceptions, and
nine of the heads of families had either been on farms or had
worked on farms in the past.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> They were in narrow circumstances
financially, and the transportation expenses of all
except one of these families were paid by the Army. With this
migration as a basis, the number of colonists was greatly increased
by families from different cities and also from the surrounding
country, until in 1905, there were thirty-eight families.
Several were brought to the Colony as experienced men to
act as pace-setters for the others.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Some came with a small
amount of capital.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that the land was covered by a heavy sod
which needed considerable working, no crops were raised the
first year, and only fair crops the second. During the first year,
the colonists were supported by cash loans which were charged
against them. After the first two years, crops were good<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>and the outlook was promising, in spite of certain insect pests,
but after about seven years a great difficulty showed itself. The
land on which the Colony was located was alkali land, and bottom
land, without any drainage. The result of constant irrigation was
that the alkali rose to the surface in larger and larger quantities,
until no good crop could be raised. The only salvation was to
drain the land and thus rid it of the blighting alkali. This meant
an expense of from $30.00 to $40.00 an acre. At the present
time draining is being rapidly pushed forward and is proving
very beneficial, but it can be easily seen what a discouragement
the alkali has proved to the colonists, and what an additional
expense is laid upon them and the Colony; an expense which
it will take years of good crops to overcome.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Up to 1905, about eighteen families, not satisfied with the results
obtained, had moved away, and their places had been filled
by others. A very few of the departing families moved because
of ill-health; some thought that they could do better elsewhere
as farmers; some even had considerable money as a result
of their holdings in the Colony<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. Since 1905, there has been
a good deal of changing, and at present a large part of the Colony
land is rented out by the Army to settlers; some being from the
country, and some from the city<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. A small number of the
old pioneer colonists still remain and have done well with their
holdings in spite of all difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p><p>The Army stated in 1905, that the financial standing of this
Colony showed a net loss to the Army of $23,111.50, and a gain
to the colonists of $37,943.77. It considered its loss a cheap price
for the experience gained, but thought that it had erred in giving
the colonists too liberal terms.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> By this time the loss to the
Army is considerably greater, owing to the increased expense of
drainage.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>At the present time (January, 1908), the population of this
Colony is about 200. Nearly all the land is occupied in one way
or another, either by colonists who own, or partially own, their
land, or by renters, who are also called colonists. Several homes
are vacant, but it is expected that they will be filled by renters
before the Spring season opens. The little village consists of
several stores, a blacksmith shop, a substantial railroad depot,
a post office, a small hotel and a school house. A good many of
the homes are built of stone, quarried on the Colony, and present
a good appearance. Up on the higher land is situated a large
stone structure, built by the colonists at an expense to the Army
of $18,000.00, and first used as an orphanage, then as a sanitorium,
and now abandoned. Irrigation ditches with a good flow
of water are in evidence, and preparations for draining the land
are under way. That this is necessary is forced upon us by the
many white patches scattered here and there where the water,
having evaporated, has left the destructive alkali salt on the surface
of the ground.</p>

<p>When we come to consider the other Farm Colony, Ft. Romie,
situated at Soledad, Cal., in the beautiful Salinas Valley, we receive
a more favorable impression, although we find that the
Colony here has had many difficulties with which to contend.
The Colony is smaller than that at Ft. Amity, but the land
is better. The original 500 acres has been increased by the
addition of a lease of 150 acres with the option of buying. In
the year 1898, eighteen families were taken from the poor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>San Francisco and placed upon the Colony, but unforeseen conditions
prevailed, and, as a result, but one of these families remains
to-day.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The great mistake was made of settling
colonists upon land which needed irrigation, before that irrigation
was provided. This mistake was brought out the more
vividly, in that the three first years of the Colony's existence were
years of drought, bringing evil to most parts of the State, and
especially to that land which, like the Colony land, only received
a slight rain-fall at best. The result of the first years of this
experiment, then, was an abandoning of the land by the colonists,
and a loss to the Army of $27,000.00.</p>

<p>The experiment was continued, however, but with very different
conditions. An excellent irrigation system was established,
and a new lot of settlers brought to the Colony; not, this time,
from the city, but from the surrounding country. These people
were poor, but accustomed to the land. The result, as might be
expected this time, was more favorable. It was stated in 1905
that no colonists had left since 1901.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In May, 1903, there
were nineteen families ranged according to nationality as follows:&mdash;Thirteen
American; Two Scandinavian; One Finn; One
German-Swiss; One Dutch and one Italian. There are now
twenty-five families, and about one hundred and forty-five persons
on the Colony. The nucleus of a town is to be seen with two or
three stores, a blacksmith shop, and a good sized Town Hall.
Near the Colony is a school house with an attendance of about
fifty children, most of them being colonists' children.</p>

<p>An irrigation plant has been established and is now owned and
worked by the colonists, formed in a joint-stock company. The
colonists raise beets, potatoes, alfalfa, fruits of different kinds,
and stock. A large part of their income is derived from the
dairying industry. They ship their cream to a creamery at
Salinas, about twenty-five miles distant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p><p>Much could be said about the healthy appearance and happy
life of the members of this Colony, but as they have not been
brought from the unhealthy, squalid misery of the city, this is not
of so much interest. The women work in the vegetable gardens
and with the stock, as well as in the home; and the older
children help their parents.</p>

<p>Along the lines of co-operation, in both colonies there are interesting
features. At stated intervals, the colonists meet in the
form of a Farmers' Club, and discuss questions relative to the
success of their individual farms and to the Colony as a whole.
They also have lecturers come from a distance to address
them on the latest phases of horticulture, agriculture, fertilization
and irrigation. The colonists also embark in business enterprises
like the stock company formed in the California Colony for the
control and management of the irrigation plant. In this plant,
one of the colonists is engineer, and another the superintendent
of water supply. Another important institution of this same
Colony is the Rochdale store, which does most of the retail business
in the Colony. This store, in its management and organization,
follows the co-operative Rochdale system, which has attained
strength in England and is growing in the United States.
The store is incorporated in the State of California as a co-operative
corporation, and holds a membership in the State
Rochdale Wholesale Co. It has already extended beyond the
limits of the Colony and counts among its members others than
colonists. The colonists also take active interest in local affairs
of all kinds. In one colony, the rural mail carrier is a colonist,
and the school teacher the wife of a colonist. At Ft. Amity,
a colonist is now sheriff of the County for the second time.</p>

<p>Social and religious life is also fostered in the Colonies. A
variety of religious sects is represented, and no compulsion is
exercised towards any one of them. At Ft. Romie the Army
has an organized corps, which holds meetings once in the week
and once on Sunday, also having a Sunday school for the children.
At Ft. Amity similar conditions prevail. On both colonies
a good moral influence is found and there are no evil surroundings;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>hence in neither colony is there a local officer of the law.
In the contract which every colonist signs on taking his land
there is a temperance clause to this effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And party of the second part hereby agrees to and with party
of the first part that, in consideration of the benefits derived from
this contract, he will not bargain, sell, barter or trade upon said
land any intoxicating liquors, or otherwise dispose of as beverages
any intoxicants, at any place upon said premises or any part thereof,
or permit the selling of the same, or any illegal traffic or any act or
acts prohibited by law."</p></div>

<p>The same clause goes on to provide for the return of the
land to the Army in case of its being violated.</p>

<p>From this brief description it is seen that much of the success
of these colonies must rest on the management. The manager
must be large-hearted and broad-minded. He must be
supervisor, instructor, moderator, counsellor and friend. The
Army has been very fortunate in placing fit men in these positions,
and if in other things it had been equally fortunate, its colonies
would have made a better showing.</p>

<p>As regards the financial methods of the Army in dealing with
the colonists, the following extract from a memorandum of information
issued by the Ft. Romie Colony, California, gives
typical information.</p>

<p>1. Land: Twenty acres of land are sold to each colonist. The
price of unimproved land at this date, 1904, is $100.00 per acre.
This price, however, is liable to be increased at any time.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>2. Buildings: Houses, barns and other buildings are constructed
by the colonists. Materials are furnished in quantities by the Army
according to the size of the colonist's family, somewhat after the
following schedule. For a family with one or two small children,
a two-room house, about 14&times;24 outside measurement, for
which we appropriate not over $125.00. This is to include a
small barn or shed for horses, cows, etc. For a family with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
three or four small children, a three-room house about 18&times;24,
costing with barn, etc., not over $175.00. For a larger family,
perhaps a four or five-room house, limiting the appropriation
for the same to $225.00. Colonists can suit themselves as to
the style of the house, but must satisfy the manager that it can
be erected within the limits of the appropriation named. The
colonist can add to the size of the house as he gets on his financial
feet.</p>

<p>3. Terms: On land breaking and other permanent land improvements,
the colonists are given 20 years' time. The principal
and interest are payable in installments each year.</p>

<p>4. Outfit: To colonists unable to purchase them, the Army
furnishes the necessary implements and stock, consisting of the
following: Team of horses, cow, hogs, chicken, seed, etc., secured
by chattel mortgage. The interest on outfit and loans is
fixed at 6 per cent. It is expected that the principal and interest
will be repaid in installments each year. All outfits and loans are
to be repaid within five years.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>We have briefly outlined the most prominent features of the
Farm Colonies, but the final questions now arise, is the movement
sound; what does it signify, and what development does the
future hold for it? For one thing we must not be led astray by
the statements of the Army. The continued existence of the
colonies, in the face of great difficulties, through the term of
eight or nine years they have been carried on, is not in itself
an argument for the soundness of the movement. From ocean
to ocean and throughout the world, the Army has advertised its
success in colonizing enterprises, and hence it had a set purpose
in maintaining and continuing its colonies, even though they
should be failures from our point of view, and even though they
should not fulfil the purpose originally intended by the Army
itself. As has been remarked with regard to the industrial colonies,
so here, we would emphasize the fact that the Army has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>no need to fear acknowledgement that the colonies have not been
successful, because it has other credit upon which to depend for
its reputation for usefulness. After looking at it from all sides,
we come to the conclusion that the two experiments considered
in these pages do not justify an extension of this work. This
conclusion is based on several reasons:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Many of the successful colonists are not men who needed
help the most, and many are not from the City at all.</p>

<p>2. The colonies have been, and are, an undue expense to the
organization.</p>

<p>3. The same amount of energy and money would be more
beneficial to the unemployed if used along other lines.</p>

<p>4. The principles advanced as essential by the originators of
the movement were only partially carried out.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p></div>

<p>Our first reason is based partly on personal investigation, and
partly on the statements of the Army itself.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> There are, as
will be seen from examples given, certain places where families
from the city without previous experience have made a success
of the colonies, but these are greatly in the minority<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. If, in
the case of the California Colony at Fort Romie, when seventeen
out of the original number of families taken from the city,
left on account of the lack of water, the next group of settlers
had again been chosen from the city, after water had been
secured, a more conclusive experiment would have resulted, but
instead, the second group were, "farmers by profession."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
This looks as though the Army itself at that time doubted the
ability of the city families to succeed on the land. At any rate,
the fact that the majority of the families at the present time on
the colonies are not from the city at all, shows that, as an experiment
of removing the surplus population of the city to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>country, the colonies are a failure. But further, when we take
the minority, the families now in the colonies who came from
the city, we find that, in most cases, they are not people who
needed help the most, and those who have succeeded on the
colonies, have succeeded because of elements in their character
which would have led them to succeed in the long run anywhere,
with favorable environment. In this case then, the only advantage
in taking these people from the city was to leave more
room there for somebody else, and this is not much of an advantage,
since that "somebody else" is quite likely to come from
the country to the city, and thus not be one of the city's submerged
ones at all. Again, if, as we have just stated, men succeed
in the country because of the same elements of character
which would lead them to succeed anywhere, then the reason
for their failing to succeed in the city would lie in an unfavorable
environment, and to change their environment, it is not necessary
to carry on a system of paternalistic colonies. This leads us to
the question of assisted emigration, which we will discuss in connection
with our third objection to the colonies.</p>

<p>As regards the second reason, that of undue expense, Mr.
Haggard in 1905, found a loss to the Army of $50,000. While,
since that time, in the case of the California Colony, there has
been no further loss, yet in the case of the colony in Colorado,
there has been much expenditure which should be added to the
original loss. The Army states that it has been too liberal in
its dealings with its colonists, but we note that, in spite of its
liberality, there has been a constant tendency for the colonists
to leave, hoping to do better elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The Army might reply
that this is no argument, and that the fact that they were able
to leave with funds on hand was in itself a proof of liberality
on the Army's part, but to prove the success of its experiment,
it must show that those who have left have done better elsewhere,
and not drifted back once more to the city. The Army
might further state that in future a better selection of land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
might be made, and that other unfavorable things might be
avoided, but we are dealing here with these two colonies and not
future experiments. As regards such, there would always be
unforeseen difficulties of every kind.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Coming to the third reason for our conclusion, the reason that
money might be expended in other ways with greater advantage
to the unemployed, and with greater relief to the congestion of
cities, we refer again to the recommendations of the Departmental
Committee appointed by the English government to consider
Commissioner Haggard's report.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> In their report they
recommend a system of emigration from the city to the English
possessions, such as Canada, aided by the government, in preference
to the system of colonization. With this we agree. A
man once transported from the city and then thrown on his
own resources in a favorable rural environment, will be more
likely to succeed than a man who is taken out with a number of
others to form a colony. The man left to his own resources will
rise to the occasion, as so many have done in both Canada and
the United States, who have migrated from city to country and
made successful farmers and citizens, while, on the other hand,
the man who feels dependent on an organization, which is responsible
to the public for his success, and its own, will blame it for his
own lack of efficiency. The Army itself claims a successful work
done along the lines of emigration. In 1905, through the agency
of the Army, 2,500 men were sent out from London to Canada.
This number has since increased every year until in 1907 over
15,000 men were sent out. Many other emigration societies have
been very successful in this work.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The emigrants sent out
with some assistance, in many cases, gain new ambitions in life and
make pronounced successes on the new soil. As regards the cost,
the following quotation may be submitted. "The cost of emigration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>to Canada from England does not amount to more than
£10 a head, and some of the societies, especially those maintained
by women, seem to be successful in securing repayment
of at least a part of the money advanced. In other words, $300,000.00,
which Mr. Rider Haggard assumes as a necessary sum
for forming a colony of 1,500 families, would enable at least
6,000 families to go out as emigrants."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> With regard to conditions
in the large cities of the United States and other countries,
we believe that the same arguments would apply, and that, in
every case, assisted emigration will be found far more feasible
and beneficial than any system of colonization. Again, for reasons
already given, in addition to there being six thousand
families aided by emigration, for the same sum as fifteen hundred
families could be by colonization, the relief given would be
far preferable. In other words, emigration has been proved successful,
while colonization has not.</p>

<p>Coming back to the conclusions reached by Mr. Haggard on
his recommendations to the English government: Mr. Haggard,
after stating that the two experiments, outside of a slight failure
of finance, seemed to him to be eminently successful, says
that, given certain requisites,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It will, I consider, be strange if success is not attained even in
the case of poor persons taken from the cities, provided that they
are suited in character, the victims of misfortune and circumstances
rather than of vice, having had some acquaintance or connection
with the land in their past life, and having also an earnest desire
to raise themselves and their children in the world."</p></div>

<p>Now two of the "requisites" he mentions are, "that the land
should be cheap as well as suitable" and "that markets also with
accessibility and convenience of location should be borne in
mind," two rather difficult requisites to be found together.
Again, in the above quotation he lays down other provisos;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>among these being one that the people selected should have had
some acquaintance or connection with the land in their past lives,
a rather indefinite proviso in itself, but, from a list of poor men
out of work or in irregular or casual employment in London and
the other large cities in England in 1901 and 1906, compiled by
Mr. Wilson Fox, we find that out of a total of 8,793 such men,
ninety per cent were town born.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> We also find in New York
City in the spring of 1908, that out of a total of 185 destitute men,
about eighty per cent were town born.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> That then leaves
ten per cent in the case of England and twenty per cent in the
case of New York City from which to select or choose the ones
needed for a colonizing enterprise.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox has also shown in his investigations:</p>

<p>1. That the countrymen who migrate to London are mainly
the best youth of the villages.</p>

<p>2. That the incomers usually get the pick of the posts, especially
outdoor trades.</p>

<p>3. Country immigrants do not to any considerable extent directly
recruit the town unemployed who are, in the main, the
sediment deposited at the bottom of the scale, as the physique
and power of application of the town population tends to deteriorate.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion is then, that it would be difficult to get the men
according to Mr. Haggard's requirements, and difficult to get
the land according to his requirements, and even if such were
obtained, for reasons already stated there is no justification for
a large colonizing enterprise in the two experiments described in
this chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Salvation Army Slum Department.</span></h2>


<p>So much has been written on the question of the slums in
the past few years; so many settlements, evening recreation centers,
summer playgrounds, clubs, visiting nurses' associations,
and kindergarten associations have been organized; so much has
been done by tenement house commissions and tenement laws;
so many churches have turned from their original efforts to
the slums; that we wonder why so little is heard of what the
Army, the organization supposed especially to represent the poor,
is doing in this direction. To tell the truth, if we go down into
the slums, either those of Deptford, Whitechapel, or of Westminster,
in London; or those of the Jewish, the Italian, the
Negro, or the Irish quarters in New York, or those of the Slav
or Jewish quarters in Chicago, expecting to find there the work
of the Army much in evidence, we shall be disappointed. What
slum work is done by the Army in these densely populated corners
is done with love and earnest hearts, with sacrifice and the
best of intentions; but apparently it does not bear fruit in the same
proportion as does the work of the settlement, whether church
settlement or secular, or in the same proportion as many of the
kindergartens, summer playgrounds and evening recreation centers.
Nevertheless, the slum post of the Army is doing valuable
work and should be supported.</p>

<p>A sweeping tenement house reform can do more than any
number of settlements; a settlement can do more than the Army
slum post; but neither the tenement reform nor the settlement
does the work that a slum post does. Probably the work done
by other organizations most nearly allied to that of the Army
slum post is that done by the various organizations of church
deaconesses, which have been growing rapidly in late years, in
which women are employed by the churches to visit the poor
in their homes, and nurse the sick, besides other duties. If we
depend or count largely on the Army slum work to reform the
slums, we shall be disappointed in learning that, after years of
successful growth in the Industrial and Social Departments, the
Army has but twenty slum posts in the United States<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>of these being very small, and that it has no large number in
other countries. Such as it is, the work is well worth while.
But let us examine its origin, present status and the reason for
its relatively small growth.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the Army movement, Mrs. Booth, the
late wife of General Booth, supplemented her husband's work
by a personal visitation of the people in their homes. She proved
the utility of this work and also its place among the works
of women. From her early efforts has sprung the more widely
organized department of slum work.</p>

<p>The slum work may be divided into three divisions: visitation
work, the slum nursery, and the maintenance of the slum post.
Wearing a humbler garb, even, than the regular Army uniform,
the lassies start out on their daily tours of visitation. They take
care of the sick, and at the same time, they clean the home and
put everything in order. Often they come upon cases of need
and of want, and then they provide the little necessaries: a sack of
coal, a supply of food, or some needed clothing. They take the
children from the worn-out woman and amuse and instruct
them, while the mother does her work; and, wherever they go,
although most plainly dressed, they are clean and neat, and they
strive to make everything else clean and neat.</p>

<p>While this visitation work is going on, another most urgent
need is being supplied by the slum nursery. Here the mother
can leave her children in the morning, when she goes to her
work, and find them safely waiting for her in the evening, clean
and happy. A charge of five cents per day is made to cover the
expense of feeding the children. During the day they are well
cared for, the younger ones properly nursed, and the older
ones taught simple little kindergarten games and songs. Sometimes
children are brought here and never called for again, in
which case the Army lassies in charge must find some permanent
home for them, but this does not often happen, as the mothers
of the children are usually known by the Army workers. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>the slum nursery in Cincinnati there is also a free clinic, where
sick women and children go for treatment. Two of the most
efficient physicians of the city furnish free aid, and the medicines
necessary are provided.</p>

<p>In addition to the visitation work and the nursery, the maintenance
of the slum post means the keeping of slum quarters
and a slum hall. The "quarters" are the two or more rooms
where the lassies live, and they are located where most can be
accomplished in the way of example and influence. The hall is
for the carrying on of slum meetings, for these are regularly
held. In these meetings the roughest crowd of men, women
and children is awed into respect and reverence by the simple
slum lassies with their songs and music. Again, in this little
hall, the children of the neighborhood are gathered in a Sunday
School and taught by the slum officers. It is a most interesting
spectacle to watch these children. Many different
nationalities are represented, the dark races and the light. As
children, these nationalities mingle together more freely than in
adult life.</p>

<p>A special aspect of the slum post is the distribution of charitable
relief to the needy. It is specially situated, and has advantages
for this purpose; hence it becomes the distributing depot
for bread, soup and coal in winter, and ice in summer. For
instance, from one slum post in New York during the winter
of 1907-8, 2,800 loaves of bread were given out in one week,
and for some months, an average of from 300 to 1,000 loaves,
besides an average of two tons of coal per week. Some of this,
naturally, would go to the undeserving, but the slum officers, as
a rule, know the people of their immediate neighborhood, and
can exercise due discretion.</p>

<p>The failure of the Army slum work to increase in the same
proportion as its other branches of the social work, and its non-existence
in many quarters of our cities where it is most needed,
is due to two causes. One is the fact that the Army slum
post, more than the Army industrial home or the Army hotel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
is a religious institution, and is continually advertising and pressing
on the public its peculiar doctrines. The slum officers are
imbued with the idea that personal salvation according to the
doctrines of the Army is the all-essential need. They would
not be engaged in this work themselves were it not for the hold
these doctrines have upon them. The slum post holds its regular
meetings, exhorting its hearers to get "saved," in its own
original way. At Sunday School, the children are taught that
certain things are wrong and sinful, and these very things are
common-place in their own homes though, possibly some of them
of not much detriment. But, in a community almost entirely
Catholic or Jewish, such aggressive evangelism is not likely to
increase the influence of its advocates. Many settlements have
learned with grief, this very same lesson. Another reason for
the lack of success is the mental calibre of those engaged in
the work. However, the devotion and self-sacrifice of the Army
slum sisters is one of the most touching and sublime elements of
the slums, and it is all the more touching when it is to some extent
misdirected and misplaced. To see the tact, patience and perseverance
of these "Slum Angels" as they are often called, is a
divine object lesson in itself, and much of their work is not done
in vain, as many would testify.</p>

<p>A useful experiment is under way at one former slum post,
94 Cherry Street, New York City. In place of the old building
formerly rented by the Army here and used as a slum post, the
Army has built a commodious six-story building, which it calls
a settlement. One floor is given to a hall and parlor. Two
floors are given over to rooms to be used as class, club
and kindergarten rooms. One floor is fitted up with a dining
room and kitchen, and another with a large dormitory
and living room, to be used as a Girls' Home. On the roof,
preparations are under way for a roof garden and play-ground,
while washing facilities are provided in the basement, where poor
mothers can bring their clothes and wash them. Already the
New York Kindergarten Association has two kindergartners busy
here. Two sewing classes, averaging thirty-five members, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>organized. Mother's meetings are held, and a regular Army
Corps is organized, consisting of sixty members. This settlement
may prove an auspicious advance of the Army along these
lines.</p>

<p>To sum up, the Army Slum Department is doing valuable
work in the slums, tending the sick, exercising and bringing out
some of the better traits of humanity, and offering relief in times
of need; but it suffers from an over-desire to spread its own
peculiar doctrines of salvation, and from the lack of grasping

<h2><span class="smcap">The Salvation Army Rescue Department.</span></h2>


<p>In the United States and Great Britain, the question of the
social evil has never been thoroughly investigated and faced systematically
as a whole. In some of the large cities in the United
States, notably in Chicago and New York, the question has been
taken up in various ways by different reform societies. Probably
the best investigation made thus far has been the work of
the Committee of Fifteen, in New York City, which issued its
report in the year 1902, but the problem does not appear to
have been faced by us as a nation as it might have been. Other
countries, especially France, have paid a great deal of attention
to this form of vice. Nearly every phase of the question has
been examined by some French investigator and reported on, but
when we look for reports or investigations on the part of American
or English students, we find very little of value.</p>

<p>As regards the United States, all attempts at reaching a true
estimate of the extent of this evil have failed. Apparently, there
is no way of obtaining such information. We have seen estimates
regarding some of the cities in past years, and such estimates
are given as 40,000 prostitutes for New York City,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> 30,000
for Chicago and 35,000 for San Francisco. But these figures
have evidently been derived in a very unscientific way. The
evil is probably worse in the Western states than in the Eastern,
but we are not satisfied of the accuracy of such estimates as
35,000 for San Francisco and only 30,000 for Chicago.</p>

<p>The work known as the Rescue Work of the Salvation Army
is, to a certain extent, related to the Slum Work. The slum
officers can often work hand-in-hand with the Rescue officers,
inasmuch as their field is often on the same or adjoining territory.
At the same time, it is essential that the Rescue officer
be more highly specialized than the slum worker. During the
past few years the percentage of successful cases of reform
brought about by the Army Rescue Homes has reached as high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>as 80 or 85%, according to the Army's statistics. They, however,
are unable to keep in touch with all the girls sent out, and
hence this percentage would not be final, but even allowing 25%
off for failures not known to the Army, it is doubtful if there
is any other reform agency along this line which is as successful
as is this force of trained rescue workers.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In the United
States this force works in conjunction with twenty-two Rescue
Homes scattered throughout the States. These homes are especially
fitted for the work, some having been built for the purpose.
There are work rooms for the girls, where they can do
sewing and laundry work. There is a reading room and sitting
room, dining room, and different dormitories and sleeping apartments.
Then special facilities are provided for the care of
babies in the way of proper nurseries.</p>

<p>There are two ways in which these girls come under the influence
of the Homes and Rescue workers: either the girls come
voluntarily to the Homes, expressing their desire to leave this
form of life for a better one, or they are brought to the Home
by the direct influence and touch of the Rescue officer. These
Rescue officers make regular tours through the districts where
the girls are to be found. They watch their opportunities, and
whenever they think it wise, they speak to the girls personally.
When this is not possible, they make an advance by way of
literature. One method is to open up a conversation by means
of a little card, upon which is printed the address of the Rescue
Home, and the offer of help to any girl who is in trouble of
any sort. Some of the officers tell us that they get to know the
faces of the girls through their regular tours, and whenever
a new girl comes they are able to recognize her at once, both
by her features and her actions. In this way there have been
some instances of real prevention without the need of any curative
means whatever; instances where young girls have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>rescued from the very brink of their evil fate. One way of
reaching the girls is visitation and nursing when they are sick.
Another way is through the police courts. In some of the
latter a woman Army officer is in regular attendance, and the
judge frequently hands certain cases over to her charge.</p>

<p>Many of the girls received into the Home have had no practical
training in life; many, very little moral training, and in
the case of those who have had good training in earlier years,
the life they have been leading has so undermined their old
ideals, that the training must be repeated. Hence, the aim of
the Home is two-fold. First, the aim is to lay a strong foundation
morally. When the girls reach the Home, in most cases
they are already penitent, and ready for a change, but to make
such a complete change as is necessary to lead them back to a
normal life means the individual revolution of desire and interest.
Here is where the importance of the moral influence
of the Home is realized. Step by step the girl is led on by
the simple teaching of Christian and social ideals, until in
reality she is a changed individual. Often she looks back on
her past life with such repugnance and shrinking, that her only
desire becomes that of doing something to retrieve her past, and
she becomes an active agent in the betterment of the conditions
of other girls around her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the second aim of the Rescue Home is being
realized. The girls are taught the means of practical livelihood.
They are instructed in cooking, the care of the kitchen and
nursery, and general housekeeping. Sewing is made a prominent
feature, and in every Home a laundry is maintained, where the
girls do their own washing and sometimes outside washing.
In some Homes the fund realized from the laundry and from
the sale of clothing made by the girls is quite a help toward defraying
the general expenses. Again, at some of the Homes,
such work as book binding and chicken raising has been successfully
carried on. Independence is encouraged, and as soon
as possible the girl is made to feel that, by aiding in the work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>of the Home, she can help meet the expense which she caused.</p>

<p>To the girl who has possibly never done sewing, never known
anything about proper cooking or the care of a home, there
is much that is new in this training, and, on the other hand,
great patience is required on the part of her instructors. A fit
of anger or despondency, and in a very short time she has left
the Home and its care, and returned to her old life. Some do
this even more than once and again return, having, upon reflection,
realized the force of its love and shelter. Others, of
course, leave and never return, but a large number are sent
back to their own homes or out to fill situations of various
kinds.</p>

<p>A great difference is found between one girl and another, due
to the different status of life and surroundings from which they
originally fell; hence, some girls are reformed with greater ease
and in a shorter time than are others. The average time that
a girl is retained in the Home is about four months. The Army
aims at keeping in touch with them afterwards.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Personally," says one of the leading Rescue officers writing on
this point, "I attach by far the greatest importance to the work
done with our girls after they leave the Home. If we ceased our
care for them when they went out to service, we should have, I fear,
many failures. I have by my elbow, as I write to you, a current record
of 120 girls, not picked out but taken just as they come, which
tells just where each one is, what she is doing, what was her
spiritual condition when last seen or heard from, what day visited,
etc. That list is taken from a record kept of every girl who passes
through our hands. On one page is her previous life story; on the
other, her career after leaving the Home. It is the most important
record we keep."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p></div>

<p>Along with other departments of social service in the Army,
this department has been considerably extended during the past
few years. Figures are at hand for the United States only.
In 1896 there were five Rescue Homes with a total accommodation
for 100 girls, and there were, in the Rescue Work, 24
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>officers. In 1904 we found twenty-two homes, with a total accommodation
for 500 girls, and there were 110 specialized officers
engaged in the Rescue Work. During the eight years
prior to 1907 15,000 girls were helped.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Speaking of the
year 1903-4, Commander Booth-Tucker says: "More than 1,800
girls passed through the homes during the year, and of these
93% were satisfactory cases, being restored to lives of virtue,
while some 500 babies were cared for."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> During the past
few years, also, some valuable properties have been acquired for
the purposes of Rescue Homes. Among these are two Homes
in Philadelphia worth $20,000.00; the Home in Manhattan, New
York City, valued at $35,000.00; the Home in Buffalo, costing
nearly $40,000.00; the Home in Los Angeles, worth more than
$15,000.00, and others.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be said that although this great social
question presents almost overwhelming problems for solution,
yet there is no agency that deals with the evil in a curative way
so successfully, and on such a scale, as does the Rescue Department
of the Army. One difficulty of the work is that, while
so many departments of the Army work are self-supporting, this
work cannot be made so. Another difficulty is the lack of those
who are willing to sacrifice their lives to such noble effort. Mrs.
Catherine Higgins, former Secretary for this department, in
her report, said that she had a great need of 100 more workers,
and that she could use many times that number in the furtherance
of the work.</p>

<p>While it is rather the part of society to strike at the very
causes of this social evil and root it out entirely, still, such
successful combating with the evil itself, right on the battle-field
of flagrant vice, should receive the hearty support of all.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Some Minor Features of the Salvation Army Social Work.</span></h2>


<p>There are a number of features of the Salvation Army Social
Work, which for the sake of brevity we shall group together in
one final chapter. These are, (1): Christmas dinners, (2): prison
work, (3): the employment bureau, and (4): work among the
children. Taking up the subject of Christmas dinners, we find
here what seems to be an advertising scheme more than a systematic
form of relief. Sentiment, doubtless, has its place, even
with the masses, and yet, in this great winter feast, there is more
sentiment than there is real practical good accomplished. To
the quiet, calculating student the question arises whether it
would not be far better to utilize the vast amount of energy and
financial outlay, which it gives to gorging the multitude for
one day, in a better and more lasting way; the question whether
there is not, in these Christmas feasts, a likeness to the old time
feast of pagan Rome. In every city of any size throughout the
country the pots and kettles on the street corner are familiar
objects. At each Corps or other location of the Army, tickets
are given out entitling the bearer to a Christmas dinner, or, in
certain cases, to a basket with a dinner for a family. A good
deal of trickery is indulged in by the professional beggars, by
means of which it often happens that several dinners go to the
same person. And yet, as we have watched those 5,000 baskets
containing food for 25,000 persons go out, to bring cheer and
comfort to the hungry in their homes, and as we have gazed on
that vast banquet of 3,000 guests seated at one sitting, we could
not but feel glad that these poor brothers and sisters of ours
might realize the force of human sympathy for once in the year
at least.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Another minor feature of the Salvation Army work is the
prison work. The majority of the jails, local, county and state,
are visited at intervals by certain members of the Army set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>aside for that purpose in each community. In one State's prison
there is a regularly organized corps of Salvation Army soldiers,
who are all prisoners, some of them for a life term. In most
prisons the Army provides literature, sees to the correspondence
of the prisoners and holds meetings with them. But it is not
so much the work with the prisoners in the jail that counts, as
it is the influence gained over them, which leads them to come
to the Army and make a new start in life when they get out.
Many who find themselves behind the prison bars are not to be
classed as regular criminals. A man is often classed as a
criminal who is a victim of misfortune only, and has no inherent
criminal instincts. It is with the criminal "by occasion," as Lombroso
puts it,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> that much successful work can be done in the
way of reform. The Army has a regular organization known
as the Prison Gate League. When a prisoner is discharged he
is met by one of this league and invited to go to work at one
of the Army's institutions. After being influenced and helped
in this institution for a certain length of time, if he seems to
justify it, he is sent out to work in some position. There are
no definite statistics recorded of those of this class who have
been permanently bettered.</p>

<p>Still another minor feature is the employment bureau system.
While mentioned here as merely one of a group of minor features,
this system is one of great importance to the industrial
world. It is being taken into consideration in many places by
thoughtful men, and there is promise of its assuming national,
if not international proportions. The general term, employment
bureau, serves to bring to our recollection the accompanying
evils of the contract wage system and industrial slavery, against
which there has been agitation in the past, but it is because of
these accompaniments that the importance arises of securing a
system which shall be free from them. In Germany considerable
work has been done along these lines, municipalities and
provinces have taken up the work, and an all-round effort is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>being made to place labor in the right position for work at the
proper time.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> New York City is to-day swarming with many
agencies, which are conducted by men and women, who may
rightly be classed as extortioners. In spite of the rigid rules on
the subject, the ignorance and poverty of their victims makes evasion
of the law comparatively easy. Jacob A. Riis, speaking of
this subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is estimated that New York spends in public and private
charity every year around eight millions. A small part of this sum
intelligently invested in a great labor bureau that would bring the
seeker of work and the man with work together, under auspices
offering some degree of mutual security, would certainly repay the
amount of the investment in the saving of much capital now much
worse than wasted, and would be prolific of the best results."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p></div>

<p>In regard to the work of the Army in this field every large
city contains an employment bureau conducted by it and maintained
for the free use of the unemployed. Some of the men,
who secure positions have been in one of its own
institutions, and the Army workers know whether or not
to recommend them for a certain position. Outside of giving
men work in its own institutions, the Army, during the year
1907, found employment for 55,621 persons in the United States
alone.</p>

<p>Contrary to expectation, the children's work of the Army
has not attained a magnitude in proportion to the other lines
of work which have been developed. This may be accounted
for in part by the fact that there are more institutions open for
children to which the Army can turn for help than there are
institutions of other types. Thus, while the Army can often get
a child taken into some orphanage already existing, either public
or private, in the case of the drunkard, the unemployed or the
fallen woman, the Army finds it necessary to furnish its own
institutions. Again, the Army states that wherever possible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>some friend is found who is willing to adopt a child. Of course,
this is far preferable to placing the child in some institution,
inasmuch as adoption restores the home in a real sense.</p>

<p>The work among the children may be divided into temporary
work and permanent work. By temporary work we do not
mean work that is superficial, for it may be the most permanent
and lasting in its results, but we mean work that is undertaken
which influences the children for a limited amount of time only.
The slum nursery or kindergarten is of this type, but as we
have already described it in connection with the Slum Department,
it needs only mention here. Another line of temporary
work is the Sunday School work of the Army, but that comes
under the religious work and not the social.</p>

<p>An important line of temporary work, however, is the summer
outing for the poor children. In each of our large cities
these excursions for the poor children have been carried out
on a large scale. Arrangements are made with a railroad or
a steamboat company; the children are collected, hundreds at
a time, and cared for by parties of Salvationists, they are taken
out to the country for the day. Children who have never seen
the country, and who do not know what a tree, a green hill, or the
running water looks like, are thus given an entirely new outlook
upon the world, and a lasting impression is made on their minds.
In Kansas City, this line of work has been developed still further.
One of the large parks has been handed over to the Army
by the city authorities, and in it has been established a summer
camp. Tents are pitched on the grass under the trees, and
poor families are brought out here for a week at a time. In
this way hundreds of families have experienced a little of summer
vacation who otherwise would never have left their slum
dwellings.</p>

<p>The permanent handling of the children as opposed to the
temporary, begins with the Maternity Homes which are managed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>in connection with the Rescue Homes, and continues on through
the Orphanages. The children cared for in this permanent way
are the babies from the Maternity Homes and orphans.
From this it must not be supposed, with regard to the Maternity
Homes, that there is any intentional separation or even a suggested
separation of the child from the mother, but in many
cases, after a time, a partial separation is necessary. The mother
is influenced and taught to care for and love her offspring, but
after spending some months in the Home, she may take a situation
of some sort, often as a domestic servant, and here
she cannot take her baby. Hence, in such cases, the mother is
expected to visit her child frequently, and to provide for its
support.</p>

<p>The other class of children dealt with in a permanent way are
those who are picked up from the street, or who otherwise fall
into the hands of the Army, often after being deserted by their
parents. While Orphanages, as already stated, are not an important
item in the Army's work, there are several in England
and four in the United States. For the situation of an Orphanage,
a country location is sought. For instance, one near New
York City is located on a beautiful piece of property at Spring
Valley. Another is at Rutherford, N. J. One of the largest is
situated near San Francisco, California, and one of the latest
additions for this purpose has been the securing of a fine piece of
property at Lytton Springs, Cal. In all, there is accommodation
for two hundred and twenty-five children in the United States.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></h2>


<p>We have now covered the work of the Salvation Army social
movement in its different branches. We have described the
work, the extent and the management of each department. We
have also considered the criticisms and objections to which each
department is open, and we have attempted to estimate the value
of each department to society. We have arrived at the conclusion
that the work of the Industrial Department, leaving out the Industrial
Colony, is a practical, deserving and successful effort to
put unfortunate men once more on their feet, at no expense to
the public, saving a slight embarrassment to those already engaged
in the salvage and second hand business; that the Army
lodging house is the best so far offered for the housing of the
lower homeless class, although not entirely satisfactory; that the
Slum Work is good, but limited in its scope, owing to the religious
sentiment attached, and the mental inferiority of its
workers; that the Rescue Work is about the best of its kind; and
that good work is being done in other directions, such as the
prison work, the employment bureaux and the children's work.
On the other hand, we have found that the two Industrial
Colonies and three Farm Colonies are not successful enough to
warrant any additional expenditure on them or on any new
colonies. This is due to the fact that the class most needing help
in the cities is not the class to succeed on the land, and to the fact
that men are more successful as pioneers on the land, when they
are scattered and left to rely on themselves, having experienced
farmers as neighbors, than when they are grouped closely together
in one colony. Also there is nothing in favor of heavy
expenditure for Christmas dinners, since the same amount of
money can be put to better advantage in other ways.</p>

<p>But, having reached these conclusions regarding the separate
departments of the Army social work, what about the movement
as a whole? The critics have advanced a good many objections
against the Army. Some of these objections relating to special
departments and not to the Army as a whole, we have already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>dealt with in our discussion of those separate departments.
There remain six principal objections:</p>

<p>1. That the organization is narrow and not willing to cooperate
with other organizations.</p>

<p>2. That the highly centralized military form of government is
likely to lead to disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>3. That the Army, in its financial dealings, does not take the
public sufficiently into its confidence.</p>

<p>4. That the Army collects funds, on the strength of its social
work, and applies these funds to religious propaganda.</p>

<p>5. That there is a lack of accuracy in its reports of work accomplished.</p>

<p>6. That the Army, as an organization, has become more of an
end in itself, than a means to an end.</p>

<p>Regarding the first objection, the narrowness and lack of cooperation,
we think there is a good deal of truth in it. The
Army has made a great success as an organization, and the work
of its founder and his assistants is one of the most remarkable
achievements of the age. Things apparently impossible have
been accomplished, and obstacles apparently unsurmountable have
been overcome. The result is a self-confidence and assurance,
amounting in many cases to bigotry. The members of the organization
look upon it as especially favored by God, and as
above any other organization. Hence, we find many of the
leaders far from humble in their bearings, whatever their profession
may be, and entirely uninclined to cooperate with other
organizations. This fact has been brought to the foreground of
late years in England and America by a certain amount of
antagonism between the Army and the Charity Organization
Society, the Army claiming that it can do its work along its own
lines and get along without any alliance with the Society, and the
latter claiming that much economy would result if the Army
would unite its efforts along social lines with the Charity
Organization Society. The controversy cannot be discussed here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>but it seems a pity that some sort of union cannot be entered into
in which both organizations would be represented in a manner
satisfactory to both. One great difficulty, evidently, is the
religious element in the social work of the Army, which tends to
prejudice the Charity Organization Society in some degree against
the Army, and tends to keep the Army aloof from any
organization considered secular. However, we find many leading
officers in both organizations with friendly feeling, and there is
hope that the time will come, when the controversy will be at an
end.</p>

<p>Coming to the second objection, that the highly centralized
military form of government of the Army is likely to lead to
disastrous consequences, we think that, if continued, this form
of government must indeed lead to disaster. It is evident that
this might happen in different ways. In an organization held
together by one man or by one idea, disintegration would tend to
take place in the one case by the failure or death of the leader,
and in the other case by the expansion of the idea. The Army is
held together by both the man and the idea, and we need not turn
away from its own history to get examples of this disintegration
in both ways. Take the first bond of union, the man of striking,
hypnotic personality. Since the very inception of the movement,
time after time, men who have gained influence in the Army, have
separated from its ranks and started a movement of their own
of more or less formidable dimensions. The instance most
applicable here is that of the division which took place a few years
ago in the United States. At that time the Army in this country
had been very successful under the leadership of one of General
Booth's sons, Ballington Booth and his wife, Maud, the latter
especially being a most attractive and talented personality and
gifted, persuasive speaker. Mr. and Mrs. Ballington Booth
were flattered by attention from all sides, and by the worship of
the soldiers and officers under them. Orders came from General
William Booth, commanding them to give up their leadership in
the United States and take control of some other country. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>they had no idea of giving up their position in this country, and,
elated by success, confidently announced their leadership of a new
movement, the Volunteers of America, which is still in existence.
While the other element, that of the expansion of the idea,
showed itself at this time in a revolt against the narrow, despotic
methods of General William Booth, the main element in this
division was that of personality. Taking up the second bond of
union, that of the central, controlling idea and purpose, we find
the whole movement at the present time is tending to disintegrate
through the expansion of this idea. This is shown by the continual
departure of men from the ranks of the Army, who see
that its methods and machinery are too cramped for their efforts,
and also by the different attitude of the remaining members towards
the movement itself and its leader General William Booth.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that there will gradually be effected a
change in the form of government of the army which will allow
for enlargement and differentiation within the movement itself.
General Booth, the sole head of the movement, cannot live much
longer, and at his death, changes already threatening will demand
attention. He has maintained a remarkable control over his
world-wide following, in spite of numerous outbreaks and
dangerous splits, and has legally arranged with great care, we are
told, the succession to follow him. But that there will ever be a
second General Booth, or that there could be a series of General
Booths, able to hold the organization as he has, is incredible. We
have talked with leading officers of his Army on this subject and
find that they too, are looking for changes. The fact that the
social work is having such a remarkable growth, while the
spiritual work is apparently unable to hold its own, is in itself a
feature demanding a change. The Army of industrial and social
officers and employees will not be bound by the same ties to the
General as his former Army of spiritual officers and soldiers.
The latter were possessed with an emotional, fanatical enthusiasm
which blinded them to everything save the service of their much
adored General. The former have a different outlook on life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>They are the new Army, a result of tendencies inherent in the
growth of the movement. They look at humanity and individuals
from other standpoints than that of the salvation of the soul. The
material side of society, with its institutions of business, and
practical forms of charitable relief, occupies a large amount of
their attention. This has already led to considerable differentiation
of government and control. Take, for example, the
corporation, "The Industrial Homes Company" controlling eighty-four
industrial institutions in the United States, and managed by
a board of directors in New York City. This example is opening
the way toward a future government by a board of some sort
for other departments of the Army, and in time for the spiritual
department, and then the further step of representation of members
on these boards will not be far distant. At any rate we see
reason for hoping that, while other improvements are taking
place, the government of the Army will not be a handicap to the
movement.</p>

<p>By the third objection, that the Army in its financial dealings
does not take the public sufficiently into its confidence, is meant
that complete records of detailed expenditure are not issued. The
public provides for a large part of the income of the Army, and
it has a right to know just how and where that income is spent.
The man and woman who is being continually confronted by a
lassie on the street with a little box for the receipt of contributions,
after contributing again and again, is likely to ask the question,
just where is this money going; and it would be of advantage to
the Army itself, if it would issue a more definite statement of the
use to which it puts public money. Some people are satisfied with
the general report that "the Army is doing good," but there are
many who would contribute more largely, if they knew directly
for what they were contributing. In reply to this criticism, the
Army states that it deposits regularly with the state authorities
a statement showing the disposition and state of the finances of its
corporations, such as "The Reliance Trading Company" and
"The Salvation Army Industrial Homes Company."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>The Army also issues every year a balance sheet which shows
its assets and liabilities on a large scale. But this is not sufficient.
The ordinary person can receive no light from either the statement
deposited with the state authorities or the yearly balance
sheet published by the Army. In fact, although the Army uses
the services of an expert accountant in getting out this balance
sheet, for all that the public knows, it may be using the funds
entrusted to it in any way it wishes. This should be remedied by
a regular statement, clearly revealing the disposition of every cent
donated.</p>

<p>A discussion of the preceding objection leads us to the fourth
objection, that the Army collects funds on the strength of its
social work, and applies these funds to the carrying on of its
religious propaganda.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The Army denies this, but admits that
there is a good deal of money collected for the general work,
there being no specific object implied when it is collected, other
than a statement of the various departments in which the Army
is working, and of their extent. Of course, the social work comes
in for strong presentation on the statement, but the money not
being collected for any one object, the Army is at liberty to apply
it to any branch of its work whether spiritual or social. This
again shows the need of greater definiteness and accuracy in the
Army's report to the public.</p>

<p>A fifth objection is the lack of accuracy shown by the Army in
its reports of work accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> This has special reference
to the statistics published by the Army, and is a good criticism.
At different times and in different parts of the world, statistics
are given out, which seems to emanate from no one authority,
which are often contradictory, and which create confusion in the
mind of the person wishing to get at the facts. As a result of a
good deal of recent criticism on this point, all future statistics of
the Army in the United States are to come from one point only,
are to be in charge of an expert, and no publication of statistics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>is to be allowed without the consent of the National Headquarters.</p>

<p>The sixth and last objection is a very important one and one
which has been seen in the history of organizations without
number, viz: that the organization tends to become an end in
itself, instead of a means to an end. This objection is also allied
to a former one regarding a lack of cooperation on the part of
the Army with other organizations. More and more an
organization, formed as is the Army, feels complete in itself, and
works continually for its own interests and its own glory. In a
large number of instances the objective point that was once
humanity and the glory of God tends to become the advancement
of the Army. While feeling that this objection is a serious one,
it still cannot be considered as anything but unavoidable, considering
the government and general character of the movement. If
it were possible for the Army to be governed locally, and to some
extent, nationally by boards, a part of whose membership represented
the public, we believe that the tendency to advance its
own interest would be diminished. Study out the workings and
control of this organization, and it is found a machine, ever seeking
to increase its power and field of work. If this machine could
be controlled to some extent by the public which feeds it, it might
be kept as a useful servant, but otherwise, in spite of the great
service which it does society to-day, the tendency to get away
from its object and to become an object itself, will be more and
more dangerous.</p>

<p>In conclusion, then, we find that these objections advanced by
the critics are not without foundation, and while some may be
more tendencies than actualities, it lies with the organization to
guard itself from them. We have found the Army an efficient
worker along several lines, and society owes it a considerable debt
for past service and lessons learned from it. Hence it would be a
great pity for its efficiency as a great public servant to be lessened
by a lack of publicity regarding its finance, or by a narrow, self-centered
policy, or by a too centralized form of government.
Some of the Army leaders are men of great hearts and strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>minds, and it is to be hoped that, whenever in the future, the opportunity
offers to make a beneficial change of policy in its duty
toward the public or toward its sister organizations engaged in
charitable work or in its own internal administration, that these
leaders will stand firmly for what they believe, and demand the
necessary change.</p>

<h2><a name="VITA" id="VITA"></a>VITA.</h2>

<p>The author of this dissertation, Edwin Gifford Lamb, was born
in London, England, December 22, 1878. He attended private
schools in that city and then spent three years in Northwestern
Canada without schooling. After this he went to California
where he prepared for college in the preparatory department of
the University of the Pacific. He became a citizen of the United
States as soon as eligible and graduated from Leland Stanford
Junior University in 1904, with the degree of A. B. In the year
1904-'05, he was a student at Union Theological Seminary and
Columbia University. During the year 1905-'06, he held a
scholarship in Sociology at Columbia University. At this institution
he studied under Professors F. H. Giddings, John B.
Clark, H. R. Seager, H. L. Moore, J. Dewey, F. J. E. Woodbridge
and W. P. Montague. Since that time he has been an instructor
in the Harström School, Norwalk, Connecticut.</p>
